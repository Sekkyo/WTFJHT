  <p><strong>ðŸ‘‹ Away Message</strong>: So we had a little scheduling snafu here at WTF HQ, where both myself and Joe (<a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/podcasts/">voice of the pod</a>) double-booked ourselves with personal and professional obligations next week. Oopsie! Not a very great job using a calendar on my part, I guess. On the other hand, it appears the government isn't going to be open for business anyway... Unless something truly WTF-y happens, I'll see you all again on <strong>Tuesday, October 10th</strong>, because Monday is a holiday (Indigenous Peoples' Day).</p>
