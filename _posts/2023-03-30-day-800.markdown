1/ **The Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump for his role in the hush-money payment to a porn star during his 2016 campaign**. The felony indictment makes Trump the first former president to face criminal charges. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been investigating whether Trump falsified business records in a way that could constitute a campaign-finance violation. Michael Cohen previously said that Trump directed him to buy Stormy Daniels’s silence for $130,000 during the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign, and that Trump and the Trump Organization classified his reimbursement as "legal expenses." \[*Editor's note: This is a developing story.*\] ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/03/30/nyregion/trump-indictment-news) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/manhattan-grand-jury-voted-whether-indict-trump-rcna73588) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/30/trump-ny-indictment/))

2/ **A federal judge in Texas invalidated the Affordable Care Act's mandate that insurers and employers offer certain preventive health care services**, including some cancer and heart screenings. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor ruled that the law's requirement that ACA plans cover HIV-prevention measures violates federal law guaranteeing religious freedom. The lawsuit was brought by six individuals and two Christian-owned businesses who argued that the mandate would make them "complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior." In 2018, O’Connor [struck down](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/12/17/day-697/) the entire ACA on the grounds that “the individual mandate is unconstitutional.” The Supreme Court, however, [upheld](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/06/17/day-149/#1-the-supreme-court-upheld-the-affor) the ACA. It was the third time that the Supreme Court ruled the ACA constitutional.

* **The FDA approved an over-the-counter Narcan, an opioid overdose reversal drug**. "The approval marks the first time any form of naloxone will be available without a prescription. The drug, which first received FDA approval in 1971, was originally an injection. The FDA approved the inhaled nasal spray version, more commonly known as Narcan, in 2015. It contains 4 mg of naloxone that can be sprayed into the nose like a common allergy medication." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/29/fda-otc-narcan-spray-approval-00089376))

3/ **House Republicans passed legislation that would increase oil drilling and mining on public lands and waters**. The Lower Energy Costs Act would increase domestic production of oil, natural gas and coal, cut some environmental regulations, ease permitting restrictions for pipelines, refineries and other projects, and repeal sections of the Inflation Reduction Act – the landmark climate change legislation that Biden signed into law last summer. All but one Republican – including four Democrats – voted in support of the bill. Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, called the package “dead on arrival” in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Biden has also said he'll veto the measure if it reaches his desk, calling it “a thinly veiled license to pollute.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-energy-oil-biden-republican-congress-b2d799a4b69dec464afb906c14f938d2) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/30/house-republicans-energy-legislation/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/us/politics/gop-energy-bill.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-to-vote-on-gop-energy-agenda-boosting-oil-and-gas-production-7367ca25?mod=djemalertNEWS) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/politics/house-republican-energy-bill) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/30/house-republicans-marquee-energy-bill-00089529))

4/ **A train hauling ethanol derailed and caught fire in Minnesota, triggering an evacuation of residents living near the crash site**. The evacuation order was lifted hours later. Twenty-two cars carrying ethanol and corn syrup derailed  around 1 a.m., and four caught fire, according to a BNSF Railway statement. The fire burned more than 8 hours. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/evacuation-order-issued-minnesota-train-derailment/story?id=98227514) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-train-derailment-evacuation-ethanol-fire-73cc3e80f616070806f8f8b35191a616) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/train-carrying-ethanol-derails-catches-fire-sparking-evacuation-reside-rcna77363) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/30/1166998646/minnesota-train-derailment-evacuation-fire-ethanol) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/us/raymond-minnesota-train-derailment/))

5/ **The Senate passed a bill to end the national Covid-19 emergency**, which Trump declared on March 13, 2020. The resolution cleared the House earlier this year and now heads to Biden’s desk, who said he plans to sign it despite his his opposition to ending the Covid-19 emergency. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/politics/vote-to-end-covid-emergency-congress/index.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/covid-biden-senate-national-emergency-bill-f0e08810c28cc648a9b778a86d2dc7e1) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/30/biden-house-democrats-covid-emergency))

6/ **Kevin McCarthy – again – declined to say whether the House would consider an assault weapons ban following the Nashville school shooting**. When asked about calls for gun reform, McCarthy filibustered the press conference saying: "There's not one person in America who doesn't want to try to solve all this. We want to make sure we're taking all the information. I would say to the nation as a whole that the problem that we \[have\] today, it's not just going to be legislation. We've got to have a severe conversation here with this country. We've got to deal with mental illness. I don't think one piece of legislation solves this. I think a nation together, working together, solves a problem that's much bigger than us. We will get all the information, how we deal with any subject, and we'll work through it." A Democratic lawmaker, meanwhile, yelled at his Republican colleagues and repeatedly called them “cowards” for not supporting stricter gun measures in the wake of the Nashville school shooting. While several lawmakers walk by Jamaal Bowman without engaging, Republican Thomas Massie stopped to tell Bowman that "there's never been a school shooting in a school that allows teachers to carry." Massie then added: "Calm down." Bowman responded: “Calm down? Children are dying. Nine-year-old children. The solution is not arming teachers."

* **After a mass shooting at an elementary school in Texas last year, Republican-led states moved expand access to firearms**. One of them was Tennessee, where a shooter carrying multiple weapons killed six people, including three children. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/us/nashville-gun-laws.html))

* **Why do Americans own AR-15s?** "Self-defense was the most popular reason for owning an AR-15. Other popular answers included recreation, target shooting and hunting, while some pointed to owning an AR-15 as their Second Amendment right."
