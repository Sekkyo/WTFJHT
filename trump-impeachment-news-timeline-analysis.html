<h2 id="an-executive-summary-of-trumps-two-impeachments">An Executive Summary of Trump&#39;s Two Impeachments.</h2>
<p>Donald Trump&#39;s presidency was marked by two unprecedented impeachment trials, highlighting significant issues in American politics and governance. </p>
<p>The first impeachment revolved around allegations that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his political rival, and obstructed Congress in its investigation. Impeachment managers accused Trump of a cover-up, alleging he attempted to bury evidence and only released military aid to Ukraine after getting caught, which led to an investigation and whistleblower complaint becoming public​​.</p>
<p>The second impeachment followed the Capitol insurrection on January 6th, with Trump being charged with incitement of insurrection. Trump&#39;s legal team argued that he had not directly called for violence and that those who stormed the Capitol did so of their own accord​​.</p>
<p>Proponents of the impeachments argued that Trump&#39;s actions represented a clear abuse of power and a danger to democratic processes. His opponents, however, contended that the impeachments were politically motivated and lacked sufficient evidence of any crime.</p>
<p>The impeachments intensified political polarization and raised questions about the balance of power and accountability of a sitting president. While neither trial resulted in a conviction, they underscored the mechanisms of checks and balances within the U.S. political system and the ongoing debates about the extent of presidential power.</p>
<p>The Trump impeachment trials are not just political events but touchstones in American history, reflecting on the state of U.S. democracy, the importance of accountability, and the ongoing challenges of political polarization. For the average American, these trials offer crucial insights into how their government operates and why active participation in the democratic process remains essential.</p>
<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>
<p><strong>No Convictions</strong>: The Senate&#39;s failure to convict Trump in both trials illustrates the significant challenges inherent in the impeachment process. The outcomes were shaped by a political landscape where party loyalty often trumped bipartisan considerations. The acquittals were perceived differently by various segments of the population: some saw them as a failure of the system to hold a leader accountable, while others viewed them as a vindication of Trump and a rebuke of what they saw as a partisan impeachment process. The fact that a supermajority is required for conviction in the Senate underscores the difficulty of achieving consensus across party lines in a highly polarized environment. In both trials, the defense argued that the impeachment process was being misused for partisan purposes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, after voting to acquit in the second trial, still condemned Trump&#39;s actions, stating, &quot;There&#39;s no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Historical Precedent</strong>: Being the first president to be impeached twice sets a historical precedent. Understanding this context is key for Americans to gauge the health and direction of their political system. The first impeachment centered around a July 25, 2019, phone call in which Trump was accused of withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage to secure investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. This situation led to the impeachment charge of abuse of power, as detailed by impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, who described it as a &quot;failed&quot; effort to &quot;coverup&quot; Trump&#39;s attempt to &quot;cheat&quot; in the 2020 election by pressuring a foreign power​​. The second impeachment came after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, with the House charging Trump with &quot;incitement of insurrection.&quot; This charge was based on the accusation that Trump&#39;s speech that day, in which he repeated false claims of a stolen election and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, had directly led to the violent events that transpired. This made Trump the first president to be impeached twice, and the first to be impeached for inciting violence against the country&#39;s own legislative body. Regarding the first impeachment, it&#39;s notable that the House Intelligence Committee, led by Representative Adam Schiff, played a central role. Schiff argued, &quot;The president&#39;s misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won.&quot; This highlights the concern about election integrity central to the impeachment. In the second impeachment, Representative Liz Cheney, a notable Republican voice, stated, &quot;There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.&quot; This underscores the bipartisan concern over Trump&#39;s actions on January 6.</p>
<p><strong>Abuse of Power and Obstruction</strong>: The first impeachment accused Trump of leveraging foreign aid to Ukraine for personal political gains and obstructing the Congressional inquiry. Despite evidence and testimonies, Trump and his allies dismissed the allegations as a political witch hunt.</p>
<p><strong>Incitement of Insurrection</strong>: The second impeachment focused on Trump&#39;s role in inciting the Capitol riot. His defense argued that he did not directly call for violence, a stance that resonated with his supporters but was contested by others, including some within his party.</p>
<p><strong>Political Polarization</strong>: Both impeachments showcased deep partisan divisions in the U.S. Congress and among the public. The trials ended in acquittals largely along party lines, reflecting a politically polarized environment. The defenses presented by Trump&#39;s legal team often reflected the broader narrative adopted by the Republican Party. During the first impeachment, Trump&#39;s lawyers, like Pat Cipollone, argued that the Democrats were basing their case on &quot;presumptions&quot; and &quot;guesswork&quot; and that Trump had &quot;valid reasons&quot; for his actions regarding Ukraine​​. In the second impeachment, Trump&#39;s attorneys posited that the Capitol insurrection was perpetrated by individuals acting &quot;of their own accord and for their own reasons,&quot; suggesting that Trump&#39;s words were not a direct call to violence​​. These arguments were not only legal defenses but also echoed the sentiments of many Republican voters and lawmakers, who felt that the impeachments were unjust and politically motivated attacks on the president. The Senate votes reflected deep partisan divisions. In the first impeachment, the Senate acquitted Trump with all but one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, voting not guilty. In the second trial, the vote was 57–43 in favor of conviction, with seven Republican senators breaking ranks, indicating a slight shift in party lines but still not enough to convict.</p>
<p><strong>Constitutional Debate and Democratic Integrity</strong>: The impeachments catalyzed a nationwide constitutional debate and underscore the importance of safeguarding democratic processes to ensure that elected officials, including the President, adhere to the rule of law. The heart of the matter was whether Trump&#39;s actions met the Constitution&#39;s standard for &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot; The first impeachment raised questions about the appropriateness of a president soliciting foreign interference in an American election, with the Democrats arguing that this was a severe abuse of power and a betrayal of national security. The second impeachment brought forward concerns about the extent to which a president&#39;s speech is protected under the First Amendment versus the potential for such speech to incite lawless action. In both cases, the Constitution&#39;s vague language on impeachment left much open to interpretation, which was reflected in the arguments of both the impeachment managers and Trump&#39;s defense team. Legal scholars were divided on the interpretation of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot; Constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz, part of Trump&#39;s defense team during the first impeachment, controversially argued that even if Trump did what he was accused of, it would not constitute an impeachable offense. In contrast, during the second impeachment, many scholars disagreed, emphasizing that incitement to insurrection clearly fell within the realm of impeachable conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Democratic Implications</strong>: The Trump impeachments Trump have had far-reaching implications for American democracy. They have tested the resilience of institutions, the strength of the checks and balances system, and the country&#39;s commitment to upholding democratic norms. While the impeachment process demonstrated the legislative branch&#39;s capacity to call the executive to account, the resulting failure to convict in both instances highlighted the limits of this mechanism when partisan interests are at play. These events have prompted ongoing discussions about the health of the democratic system in the U.S. and the importance of the rule of law, as well as the role of elected officials in protecting or endangering the democratic process. These events have sparked ongoing debate about the future of American democracy. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, remarked after the second impeachment, &quot;We have shown that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States.&quot; This statement reflects the intent of the impeachment process as a constitutional mechanism for accountability.</p>

<li><strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>: The Ukrainian President played a central role in the scandal. He stated, “I think you read everything. So I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved in democratic, open elections of USA.” This highlighted his reluctance to become entangled in U.S. politics.</li>
<li><strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>: The Speaker of the House, in announcing the impeachment inquiry, said, “The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president&#39;s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”</li>

<li><strong>Mitch McConnell</strong>: The Senate Majority Leader at the time, although voting not to convict, acknowledged Trump&#39;s role in the events of January 6, stating, “There&#39;s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.”</li>
<li><strong>Liz Cheney</strong>: A notable Republican voice against Trump, Cheney stated, “The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack.”</li>

<p><strong>After 22 days and three failed nominees, House Republicans elected a speaker to replace Kevin McCarthy</strong>. The House vote 220-209 to elect Mike Johnson as speaker – with all Republicans voting for Johnson and all Democrats voting for Hakeem Jeffries. “The people’s House is back in business,” Johnson said after taking the gavel. Johnson, who served on Trump’s defense team during his first impeachment trial, voted against certifying the 2020 election and led the amicus brief supporting a Texas lawsuit seeking to invalidate the results in four swing states Biden won. The lawsuit cited widespread voter fraud, which did not occur. The House has been unable to conduct routine business since Republicans ousted McCarthy for working with Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill to avert a shutdown. Johnson will immediately need to pass a measure to fund the government ahead of a Nov. 17 shutdown, and act on emergency aid for Israel, Ukraine, and the southern border.

<p><strong>Trump – seeking to toss federal charges that he conspired to defraud the U.S. – argued that his actions were protected by the First Amendment and that he can’t be tried again after being acquitted by the Senate during his second impeachment</strong>. In four separate motions to dismiss, Trump contends that the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/01/day-924/#1-trump-was-indicted-by-special-coun">felony indictment</a> — which charges him with conspiring to obstruct Congress’ certification of the 2020 election, conspiring to deprive Americans of the right to vote and have that vote counted, and conspiring to defraud government officials administering the election — “does not explain” how he violated the laws. Further, Trump argued that the Justice Department is criminalizing “core political speech,” and that he is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution.” Trump also claims that he has absolute immunity from federal prosecution because his efforts to overturn his election loss and remain in office were at “the heart of his official responsibilities as President.” Special counsel Jack Smith asked a judge to dismiss Trump’s claim of absolute immunity, saying its implications “are startling.” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/24/trump-seeks-to-derail-election-subversion-charges-00123141">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/politics/trump-jan-6-charges-dismiss.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/24/1208183160/trump-jan-6-case-dismissal">NPR</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-lawyers-argue-senate-impeachment-acquittal-means-2020-election-i-rcna121882">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/24/trump-jan-6-dismiss-election-subversion-case">Axios</a> / <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-federal-2020-elections-case-lawyers-new-challenges/">CBS News</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Jim Jordan failed to win the House speakership in the first round of voting after 20 of his Republicans colleagues voted against him</strong>. Jordan plans to force another vote after falling 17 votes short of the 217 he needed, saying “whatever it takes to get a speaker today.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries won 212 votes, while several Republican members voted for previous candidates for the job, including Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, who already withdrew from the race. In January, McCarthy was elected House speaker after multiple days of negotiations and 15 rounds of voting only to be ousted nine months later. The House has been without a speaker for more than 13 days. Jordan was one of the 147 Republicans who voted to reject the 2020 election results in Pennsylvania and Arizona, and was a “significant player” in Trump’s attempts to use Congress to overturn the election on Jan. 6. Jordan is also a co-leader of the impeachment inquiry against Biden despite no evidence linking him to high crimes or misdemeanors. [<em>Editor’s note: It’s entirely possibly that by the time you read this the House will have elected a speaker.

<p><strong>Instead of negotiating a deal to fund the government, House Republicans held their first impeachment inquiry hearing into Biden</strong>. The House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and his Republican colleagues on the Judiciary, and Ways and Means committees have yet to provide any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden, but continue to promise to present “two dozen pieces of evidence revealing Joe Biden’s corruption and abuse of public office.” Further, a Republican-picked witness said during the hearing that “the current evidence doesn’t support articles of impeachment,” but suggested that an inquiry was still warranted anyway. Democrats, meanwhile, accused Republicans of trying to impeach Biden as retribution for the House having twice impeached Trump.

<p><strong>Trump privately discussed impeaching Biden with House Republicans</strong>. Trump has been briefed weekly by Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, on the impeachment strategy, as well as regularly talked with members of the House Freedom Caucus and other Republicans who’ve pushed for the inquiry.

While McCarthy wasn’t explicit, he said “I would understand why members would want to bring that forward,” adding “and we’d look at it.” McCarthy also expressed sympathy for the things Trump “went through” as president. Trump was impeached twice: in 2019, for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, and in 2021, for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection.

<p><strong>A witness during Trump’s first impeachment sued Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, and two former Trump White House staffers</strong>, alleging that the group conspired to intimidate him from testifying and later retaliated against him. Retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman filed a civil lawsuit in federal court, accusing the defendants of engaging in an “intentional, concerted campaign of unlawful intimidation and retaliation” against him for testifying before Congress in 2019. Vindman alleges that the campaign was “designed to inflict maximum damage by creating and spreading disinformation” that would be repeated on Fox News and other right-wing outlets, which “destroyed” his ability to continue his career in national security and led to his retirement from the military. During Trump’s 2019 impeachment trial, Vindman testified about a July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son Hunter and his ties to Ukrainian businesses.

<p><strong>More than 100 far-right candidates are running for political office as Republicans</strong>, according to the Anti-Defamation League. At least a dozen candidates reportedly had explicit connections to “white supremacists, anti-government extremists and members of the far-right Proud Boys.” Meanwhile, the eight Republicans seeking re-election who backed Trump’s impeachment or voted to convict him have raised more money than their GOP challengers.

<p><strong>The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the  Capitol asked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to voluntarily provide information about his communications with Trump and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows</strong>. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson said he wanted to hear about discussions McCarthy had with Meadows ahead of the attack, along with McCarthy’s communications with Trump during and after the violence. “It appears that you may also have discussed with President Trump the potential he would face a censure resolution, impeachment, or removal under the 25th Amendment,” Thompson wrote. “It also appears that you may have identified other possible options, including President Trump’s immediate resignation from office.” In particular, the panel said it was interested in a phone call that McCarthy had with Trump during the riot asking Trump to send help, which McCarthy previously described as “very heated.” McCarthy is the third GOP lawmaker the panel has asked to testify. The others, Jim Jordan and Scott Perry, have rejected the committee’s requests to sit for an interview or provide documents.

<p><strong>Rudy Giuliani’s former associate was convicted on six counts related to “influence buying” campaign finance schemes</strong>. Lev Parnas – a key figure in Trump’s first impeachment – was charged with conspiring to funnel $325,000 in donations to a pro-Trump super PAC on behalf of his company, Global Energy Producers, to give the appearance of a successful business and “obtain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with politicians.” In reality, the money came from a loan his business partner, Igor Fruman, had taken out on his Florida condo. Fruman previously pleaded guilty. Parnas faces up to five years in prison for each of five counts and a sixth count for falsifying records to the FEC, which carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

<p><strong>Bill Cosby was released from prison after his sexual assault conviction was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court</strong>. Cosby was convicted on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault in 2018 for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman in 2004. He served nearly three years of a three- to 10-year sentence. The state Supreme Court concluded that Cosby’s prosecution should never have occurred because of a non-prosecution deal Cosby made with former Montgomery County prosecutor Bruce Castor, who agreed not to criminally prosecute Cosby if he gave a deposition in the civil case brought against him by the woman he drugged and sexually assaulted. Castor is the same lawyer who represented Trump during his second impeachment trial.

The attorney for Lev Parnas, an indicted former Giuliani ally, wrote in a court filing that the evidence seized “likely includes e-mail, text, and encrypted communications” between Giuliani, Victoria Toensing, Trump, William Barr, “high-level members of the Justice Department, Presidential impeachment attorneys Jay Sekulow, Jane Raskin and others, Senator Lindsey Graham, Congressman Devin Nunes and others, relating to the timing of the arrest and indictment of the defendants as a means to prevent potential disclosures to Congress in the first impeachment inquiry of then-President Donald.

<p><strong>Attorneys for Rudy Giuliani accused federal authorities of treating Trump’s former personal attorney “as if he was the head of a drug cartel or a terrorist” after learning that investigators had obtained access to his iCloud account with an undisclosed 2019 search warrant</strong>. FBI agents also <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/04/28/day-99/#2-federal-investigators-executed-sea">executed a search warrant in April</a> and seized Giuliani’s electronic devices. Federal prosecutors asked the U.S. Southern District of New York to appoint a special master to review the evidence and filter out whatever information may be covered by attorney-client privilege. Lawyers for Giuliani said the material seized from covert 2019 search was illegal and suggested the search warrants executed in April were the “fruit of this poisoned tree.” In 2019, Giuliani and other trump allies sought damaging information on Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, which became a central part of Trump’s first impeachment proceeding.

<p><strong>Former House impeachment manager Eric Swalwell sued Trump, Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, and Rep.

I may even decide to beat them for a third time.” Trump also named every Republican who supported his second impeachment and called for them to be ousted. 95% of conference attendees said the GOP should continue to embrace Trump’s policy ideas, and 68% of attendees said Trump should run again in 2024.

<p><strong>Before the vote to acquit, House impeachment managers unexpectedly called for witnesses after Rep.

Herrera Beutler said that McCarthy had relayed the details of his call with Trump to her, and that McCarthy asked Trump “to publicly and forcefully call off the riot.” Trump, instead, reportedly told McCarthy: “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.” House impeachment managers seized on her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/12/politics/trump-mccarthy-shouting-match-details/index.html">account</a>, saying they wanted to subpoena her as a witness.

<p><strong>Mitch McConnell denounced Trump minutes after voting to acquit, saying Trump was guilty of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty.”</strong> In his post-acquittal speech, McConnell said that Trump was “morally and practically responsible for provoking” the Jan. 6 insurrection, but said he is “constitutionally not eligible for conviction” because he is no longer in office. The Senate trial occurred after Trump left office because McConnell said he would not call back the Senate before lawmakers were set to return Jan. 19 unless every senator agreed to do so. The House impeached Trump on Jan. 13. McConnell also suggested that Trump could still face criminal liability, saying “The Constitution makes perfectly clear that Presidential criminal misconduct while in office can be prosecuted after the President has left office,” adding that Trump “didn’t get away with anything yet.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, called it “pathetic” for McConnell to have “kept the Senate shut down” and unable to receive the article of impeachment. Pelosi added that the 43 Republicans who voted to acquit Trump are “a cowardly group […] who apparently have no options, because they were afraid to defend their job, respect the institution in which they serve.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/us/mcconnell-trump-impeachment-acquittal.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/13/mitch-mcconnell-says-trump-caused-capitol-riot-but-votes-acquit/4476982001/">USA Today</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/after-acquitting-trump-mcconnell-slams-him-disgraceful-dereliction-duty-n1257900">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/13/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/#link-WVSW4J5WT5BBHOV6ONIHCU4OKM">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> Trump’s legal team concluded its defense, accusing House impeachment managers of “political vengeance” and calling Trump’s second impeachment trial “a politically motivated witch hunt.” Trump’s team spent two hours and 32 minutes of the 16 hours allotted to present a defense, calling Democrats’ allegations that Trump incited the Capitol riot “patently absurd” and that his calls for supporters to “fight” on his behalf “ordinary political rhetoric” that fell short of the legal standard for incitement. “No thinking person could seriously believe that the president’s January 6 speech on the Ellipse was in any way an incitement to violence or insurrection,” Michael van der Veen, one of Trump’s attorneys, said. Trump’s defense then showed a selectively edited video of Democrats using the words “fight” or “fighting” in political speeches. Trump’s other lawyer, Bruce Castor, echoed complaints of “cancel culture,” saying “Let us be clear: This trial is about far more than President Trump. It is about silence and banning the speech the majority does not agree with. It is about canceling 75 million Trump voters and criminalizing political viewpoints.” And, finally, Trump lawyer David Schoen complained about “the hatred, the vitriol, the political opportunism that has brought us here today.” He blamed Trump’s impeachment on “hatred, animosity, division, political gain – and let’s face it, for House Democrats, President Trump is the best enemy to attack.”</p>

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> The House impeachment managers prosecuting Trump rested their case, saying that if Trump is not convicted, it sets “a new terrible standard for presidential misconduct.” The managers used their final day of arguments to show how the insurrectionists – using his specific words – carried out the attack on the Capitol at Trump’s direction, warning that Trump could incite more violence if not convicted. The managers also focused on Trump’s history of celebrating violence and his lack of remorse following the Jan. 6 insurrection to demonstrate why he should be convicted and barred from holding federal office again. “Senators, America, we need to exercise our common sense about what happened,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, said in his final arguments. “Let’s not get caught up in a lot of outlandish lawyers’ theories here. Exercise your common sense about what just took place in our country.”</p>

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> House Democrats opened their impeachment case against Trump arguing that he “assembled, inflamed and incited” the attack against the U.S. Capitol because he “ran out of nonviolent” ways to overturn the result of the election. The House impeachment managers, calling Trump no “innocent bystander” but the “inciter in chief,” presented never-before-seen security footage from Jan. 6 of a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol, played audio of Capitol Police declaring a riot, and methodically detailed a nearly minute-by-minute account of what happened once the Capitol was breached. The prosecution argued that Trump sought to “prime” his supporters for the deadly Capitol attack months before it happened by engaging in a series of “false, outlandish lies” that he could only lose the election through fraud, likening Trump’s actions to someone trying “to light the match.”</p>

In fact, Trump’s other lawyer, David Schoen, was supposed to present first, but Castor told the Senate that they “changed what we were going to do on account that we thought that the House managers’ presentation was well done.” Castor also referred to Trump as the “former president,” conceding that Trump lost the 2020 election when “smart” voters elected Biden. One person familiar with Trump’s reaction said that on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the angriest, Trump “was an eight.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/us/politics/trump-bruce-castor-david-schoen.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/politics/trump-impeachment-bruce-castor/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/09/trump-impeachment-team-468112">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/10/trump-watching-impeachment-trial-tv-mar-a-lago">The Guardian</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump’s impeachment trial kicked off in the Senate with House Democrats playing a video montage of Trump whipping up a crowd of supporters</strong>, encouraging them to march to the U.S. Capitol and “fight like hell,” showing the pro-Trump mob violently breaching the Capitol, attacking police officers, and invoking Trump’s name as they tried to disrupt the certification of the November election. “Senators, this cannot be our future. This cannot be the future of America,” Rep. Jamie Raskin said in opening remarks. “We cannot have presidents inciting and mobilizing mob violence against our government and our institutions because they refuse to accept the will of the people.”</p>

<p><strong>The first day of the proceeding were devoted to a debate over the constitutionality of the House prosecuting a president who has already left office</strong>. While Trump’s lawyers condemned the violence, they rejected the suggestion that he was responsible for it and maintained that the Constitution did not allow for an impeachment trial of a former president because it was meant to lead to removal. According to his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-actions-capitol-attacks/2021/02/09/6dada250-6a3b-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html">defense attorneys</a>, Trump was “horrified” by the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, and that it is “absolutely not true” that Trump failed to quickly act to end the riot. In their revisionist history, Trump reportedly tweeted calls for peace “upon hearing of the reports of violence” and took “immediate steps” to mobilize resources to counter the rioters storming the building – these statements, however, conflict with the actual timeline of events. Bruce Castor, one of Trump’s attorneys, argued that Trump should not be punished for a “political speech,” and since he is “no longer is in office … the object of the Constitution has been achieved. He was removed by the voters.” House impeachment managers, meanwhile, argued that there is no “January exception” for presidents to escape repercussions through impeachment on their way out of office, saying the framers of the Constitution did not provide a waiver for accountability.</p>

Trump’s lawyers also argued that the Senate “lacks jurisdiction” and cannot convict a former president, calling the effort “patently ridiculous.” House impeachment managers, meanwhile, said: “We live in a Nation governed by the rule of law, not mob violence incited by Presidents who cannot accept their own electoral defeat.” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/08/trumps-legal-team-says-impeachment-is-constitutionally-flawed-senate-cant-convict-467210">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lawyers-impeachment-senate/2021/02/08/76d5d040-6a19-11eb-9f80-3d7646ce1bc0_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/08/politics/trump-impeachment-brief-filing/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/2021/02/08/965360434/trump-lawyers-reject-impeachment-case-calling-it-political-theater">NPR</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/08/us/trump-impeachment/trumps-lawyers-deny-incitement-and-urge-senators-to-dismiss-the-case">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/trump-lawyers-blast-democrats-before-impeachment-trial-deny-he-incited-capitol-riot.html">CNBC</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-leaders-near-deal-on-impeachment-trial-schedule-11612797521?mod=hp_lead_pos6">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Senate Republicans refused to agree to a power-sharing agreement unless Democrats promised to preserve the filibuster</strong>. Mitch McConnell has pressed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to keep the 60-vote threshold on most legislation as part of their agreement. Democrats, however, have rejected the proposal, saying it would be a mistake to take the filibuster off the table now that they’re in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in more than a decade. The stalemate is slowing down confirmation of Biden’s nominees, Trump’s impeachment trial, and more.

<p><strong>Mitch McConnell said the mob that stormed the Capitol was “fed lies” and “provoked by the president” into violence</strong>, referring to Trump’s attempts to overturn the election based on his baseless claims of voter fraud. McConnell’s remarks came on his last full day as majority leader, shortly before he met with Chuck Schumer to work out rules for Trump’s Senate impeachment trial for “willful incitement of insurrection.” Former Attorney General William Barr, meanwhile, said that questioning the legitimacy of the Nov. 3 election “precipitated the riot,” but he didn’t blame Trump for inciting the mob.

He has grown more and more worried about what legal or financial calamities may await him when he is no longer president, people who have spoken to him said, fueled by warnings from lawyers and advisers. He is weighing pardons, including for himself and his family, as he attempts to muster a legal team for another impeachment trial.

<p><strong>Biden urged the Senate to balance the impeachment trial of Trump with the “other urgent business of this nation.”</strong> The Senate won’t return until Jan. 19 – the day before Biden’s inauguration – which means Trump’s trial will create a logistical challenge, and risks delaying confirmation of Biden’s cabinet nominees and legislative initiatives. All 100 senators must consent to allow the chamber to confirm Biden’s Cabinet and pass his legislative agenda on one track, and begin Trump’s trial for “incitement of insurrection” on another. Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, hasn’t detailed her schedule for transmitting the single article of impeachment to the Senate.

<p><strong>Trump is reportedly in “self-pity mode” after becoming the only U.S. president to be impeached twice</strong>. According to White House advisers and people close to him, Trump and has become “increasingly isolated, sullen, and vengeful” after being left to fend for himself at the White House as impeachment quickly gained steam. Trump has also instructed aides not to pay Rudy Giuliani’s legal fees, demanding that he personally approve any reimbursements for the expenses Giuliani incurred while traveling on his behalf to challenge election results. Trump has apparently expressed concern with some of Giuliani’s decisions. The lawyers who defended Trump in his previous impeachment trial, including Jay Sekulow and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, have declined to defend him during the second impeachment trial.

<p><strong>House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment against Trump for “incitement of insurrection”</strong> for his role in the riots at the Capitol that left five people dead last week. The four-page impeachment article charges Trump with “inciting violence against the government of the United States.” Nancy Pelosi said the House will vote to impeach Trump on Wednesday if Pence doesn’t seek to remove him under the 25th Amendment or Trump doesn’t resign first. The impeachment resolution has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/11/house-trump-impeachment-457440">at least 218 co-sponsors</a> – enough to ensure passage – which would make Trump the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. While it’s unlikely that the Senate will hold a trial before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20, a conviction after his term ends would prevent Trump from federal office again. Earlier, during a pro forma session, Democrats attempted to pass a measure by unanimous consent calling on Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, but House Republicans blocked the request. Pence <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/09/politics/mike-pence-25th-amendment/index.html">reportedly</a> hasn’t ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment, but wants to preserve the option in case Trump becomes more unstable.

<p><strong>House Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday for “incitement of insurrection.”</strong> A draft copy of the impeachment resolution states that Trump “has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and […] thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.” The move follows Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s earlier call for Trump to “immediately” resign for his role in a “horrific assault on our democracy,” adding “If the President does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action.” Pence, meanwhile, privately ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The House could vote on the articles of impeachment early as early as the middle of next week. More than 196 members of the House and 37 Senators have called for Trump to be removed from office.

The Justice Department, meanwhile, is asking the Supreme Court to block the release, saying it would suffer “irreparable harm” if it had to turn over the records before the justices had decided whether to take up the appeal.

The U.S. coronavirus death toll, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/live-blog/2020-05-10-coronavirus-news-n1203881">meanwhile</a>, crossed 80,000.

<p><strong>The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block the release of secret Robert Mueller grand jury evidence</strong>. In March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cleared the way for Congress to access material from Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The administration is asking the justices to freeze that opinion. House Democrats have argued that their investigation into possible misconduct by Trump is ongoing, and that the grand jury material will inform its determination of whether Trump obstructed Mueller’s investigation and whether to recommend new articles of impeachment.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee wants to continue investigating Trump for potentially impeachable offenses related to Robert Mueller’s investigation.</strong> The committee is still trying to obtain grand jury secrets from the Mueller probe, but the Justice Department has blocked the disclosure of the materials because it plans to take the case to the Supreme Court. In a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the House wrote that “its investigation into President Trump’s misconduct is ongoing” and that material from the grand jury will help it decide whether Trump “committed additional impeachable offenses in obstructing Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller’s investigation and whether to recommend new articles of impeachment.” The letter adds: “The current pandemic notwithstanding, the Committee’s investigation is not ‘dormant.’” The committee is particularly interested in the differences between what the witnesses from the Trump campaign told Mueller’s investigators and what Trump said to Mueller in his written answers, as well as what convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said about Trump during his secret testimony.

<p><strong>Trump fired the intelligence community inspector general at the center of the Ukraine allegations that led to Trump’s impeachment.</strong> Michael Atkinson was fired months after he delivered the whistleblower complaint to Congress about Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president, as required by law. Trump called Atkinson a “disgrace” and said he fired him because Atkinson “did a terrible job, absolutely terrible.” Trump added: “He took a fake report and he took it to Congress with an emergency, OK? Not a big Trump fan, that I can tell you.” Atkinson released a statement saying that the reason Trump fired him “derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General.” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/atkinson-trump-fired-whistleblower-complaint-167371">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/03/827195027/president-trump-fires-intelligence-community-inspector-general-michael-atkinson">NPR</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/trump-inspector-general-intelligence-fired.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-he-will-fire-intelligence-watchdog-at-center-of-ukraine-allegations-that-led-to-impeachment/2020/04/03/d0b873d4-761c-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://apnews.com/57def4c165e6f2ea1d4bf1b0091e4101">Associated Press</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/trump-fires-inspector-general-michael-atkinson/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-firing-inspector-general-who-flagged-ukraine-whistleblower-complaint-n1176576">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-04/trump-fires-watchdog-who-raised-alarm-about-whistle-blower">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/04/03/trump-fires-intelligence-community-inspector-general-164287">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/4/4/21207988/trump-intelligence-inspector-general-atkinson-ukraine-impeachment">Vox</a>)</p>

National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said he decided to remove Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his brother Yevgeny from the National Security Council – not Trump. However, Trump admitted the day after Vindman’s dismissal that he was removed because he was “insubordinate” and “reported the contents of my ‘perfect’ phone calls incorrectly.” A U.S. official, however, said that neither the Army nor the Defense Department is investigating Vindman.

Earlier in the day when asked whether he wanted Vindman to leave, Trump said: “Well, I’m not happy with him.” Trump also suggested that his impeachment should be “expunged […] because it was a hoax.” And, when asked if his Democratic political opponents “should be held accountable,” Trump replied: “You’ll see.”  (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/white-house-weighs-ouster-of-aide-who-testified-against-trump">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lambastes-his-critics-as-he-considers-how-else-to-target-his-perceived-enemies-over-impeachment/2020/02/06/571003a0-4924-11ea-9475-535736e48788_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-white-house.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/vindman-who-provided-key-impeachment-testimony-escorted-white-house-attorney-n1132526">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/07/donald-trump-pressure-impeachment-witness-alexander-vindman-111997">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/alex-vindman-donald-trump-impeachment/">CNN</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump celebrated his impeachment acquittal at the White House by denouncing his “vicious as hell” enemies one-by-one</strong> before pivoting to thank his allies, praising them as “great warriors.” Trump spent the 62-minute event in the East Room boasting of his acquittal by the Senate, criticizing the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election by Robert Mueller, and blaming “crooked politics,” “dirty cops,” “leakers,” “liars,” and “bad people” for his “very unfair” impeachment. “They’re vicious and mean,” Trump said. “Vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person.” And, in a presidential use of profanity on camera, Trump added: “It was all bullshit.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/06/trump-unloads-after-impeachment-acquittal-111495">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-celebrates-acquittal-denounces-vicious-political-opponents-post-impeachment-insult-n1131666">NBC News</a>)</p>

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> The Senate voted to acquit Trump on both articles of impeachment, rejecting the House’s charges that he should be removed from office for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The vote on abuse of power failed 48-52. Sen. Mitt Romney was the lone Republican to vote in favor of the abuse of power charge. The second article, obstruction of Congress, also failed, 47-53 along party-lines. Ahead of the vote, Romney called Trump “guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust […] What the president did was wrong — grievously wrong.” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham claimed Trump’s acquittal was a “full vindication and exoneration” and that “only the president’s political opponents – all Democrats, and one failed Republican presidential candidate – voted for the manufactured impeachment articles.” The acquittal concludes five months of hearings and investigations into Trump’s withholding of U.S. military aid from Ukraine and pressuring of its leaders to investigate his Democratic rivals. A handful of Senate Republicans — Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski — argued that while the House had proven its case and that Trump’s actions were wrong, they ultimately concluded that the charges did not merit removing Trump from office. Collins <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/susan-collins-will-vote-to-acquit-trump-saying-hes-learned-from-impeachment/">said</a> she thinks Trump learned a “pretty big lesson” from the impeachment process and said she believes he will be “much more cautious in the future.” Trump, however, has continued to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-plans-to-award-presidential-medal-of-freedom-to-rush-limbaugh/2020/02/04/2d8f6a76-47a7-11ea-ab15-b5df3261b710_story.html">insist</a> that he did nothing wrong and that his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a “perfect phone call.” He sent nearly 700 tweets or retweets about impeachment – an average of more than five per day – since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened the inquiry in September. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it “a sad moment for democracy,” but that there’s a “giant asterisk” next to Trump’s acquittal because “he was acquitted without facts, he was acquitted without a fair trial.”</p>

Adam Schiff, the lead House manager, used his closing arguments to warn Republican senators that “It is midnight in Washington” and that “You can’t trust this president to do the right thing, not for one minute, not for one election, not for the sake of our country, you just can’t. He will not change and you know it.

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> The Senate voted to block new new witnesses in Trump’s impeachment trial. The 49 to 51 vote ensures the trial will be the first impeachment in U.S. history without witnesses. Two GOP lawmakers — Susan Collins and Mitt Romney — broke ranks and voted with Democrats on the motion to call new witnesses. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the failed motion “a grand tragedy.” Democrats attempted to force four amendments to Mitch McConnell’s organizing resolution, which outlines the rules for the rest of the trial. The Senate, however, voted down all four Democratic amendments to allow for the subpoenaing of documents and witnesses. Earlier in the day, Republicans and Trump’s legal team argued that new witnesses and documents were unnecessary and would only prolong the trial for weeks or months despite a Democratic proposal to limit depositions to one week. Immediately before the vote, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff warned Republican senators that “The facts will come out.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, called Republican senators who voted against witnesses and documents are “accomplices to the President’s cover-up.”</p>

According to Bolton’s unpublished book, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/36MzMHS">The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir</a></em>, Trump instructed Bolton during an Oval Office meeting to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and encourage him to meet with Rudy Giuliani to discuss the investigations into Trump’s political opponents. Bolton said he never made the call. Two months later, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate his political opponents. The Oval Office meeting was also attended by Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is now leading Trump’s impeachment defense.

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> The Senate reconvened for the final day of written questions to House managers and Trump’s defense team in his impeachment trial. Mitch McConnell indicated to Republican senators he believes he has the votes to defeat any Democratic motion that the Senate consider new witnesses. However, three Republican senators — Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney — have indicated they’re open to voting to subpoena former Trump national security adviser John Bolton. Sen. Lamar Alexander has said he hasn’t made up his mind. While attention has focused on the Republicans, three Democrats — Sens. Joe Manchin, Doug Jones, and Kyrsten Sinema — could also break ranks. Manchin has complained about what he has called the “hypocrisy” of both McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer; Jones, facing a re-election in Alabama, has hinted he might vote to acquit Trump on obstruction of Congress; and, Kyrsten Sinema hasn’t said anything public since the start of the trial other than to say she was taking her obligation seriously. Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, offered to limit witness depositions to one week after Trump’s defense warned that calling witnesses could delay the trial. Democrats, meanwhile, are attempting to undermine an expected Trump acquittal, saying that Trump cannot be truly exonerated without a fair trial in the Senate. Schumer also suggested that Democrats would use parliamentary procedures to stall a quick acquittal, saying “The minority has rights, and we will exercise those rights.”</p>

<p><strong>Trump’s legal team contradicted Trump’s Justice Department, making the opposite argument in court on the same day</strong>. In federal court, a Justice Department attorney argued that a possible remedy for an administration defying congressional subpoenas is impeachment. Meanwhile, during Trump’s Senate impeachment trial, his legal team argued that Trump was lawfully protecting the executive branch in a dispute with Congress over documents and testimony when he ordered his aides to defy subpoenas. House manager Adam Schiff later addressed the contradiction in the Senate, saying: “We’ve been debating whether a president can be impeached for essentially bogus claims of privilege for attempting to use the courts to cover up misconduct. [And] The judge says if the Congress can’t enforce its subpoenas in court, then what remedy is there? And the Justice Department lawyer’s response is impeachment. Impeachment.” Members of the Senate laughed. “You can’t make this up,” Schiff continued. “I mean, what more evidence do we need of the bad faith of this effort to cover up?” (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/politics/trump-impeachment-subpoena-hearing/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> Trump’s impeachment trial moved to written questions. Senate Republicans opened the day with Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney – three Republicans who have hinted they could vote to hear from witnesses – asking Trump’s legal team how they should consider abuse of power if Trump had “had more than one motive for his alleged conduct.” Trump attorney Patrick Philbin argued that if there were a motive “of the public interest, but also some personal interest,” then it “cannot possibly be the basis for an impeachable offense.” Trump’s lawyer Alan Dershowitz also argued that because Trump’s re-election is in the public interest, if Trump “does something that he thinks will help him get elected” – and even if he had political motivations to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens – it “cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said it was unlikely that Democrats will be able to win over enough Republican votes to call witnesses and documents. Republican leaders, meanwhile, signaled that they were confident that they would be able to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Trump signed the revised North American trade agreement</strong>. The trade deal, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, updates NAFTA, with stronger protections for workers and the digital economy, expanded markets for American farmers, and new rules to encourage auto manufacturing in North America. The USMCA must still be ratified by Canada before it can take effect. Trump excluded Democrats from the signing ceremony despite their role in securing the final version of the deal that passed with overwhelming majorities in both the House and Senate. Trump also joked that he needs senators’ votes for acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial.

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> Trump’s legal team concluded its oral arguments after less than two hours in the chamber with White House counsel Pat Cipollone calling on the Senate to “end the era of impeachment” by declaring Trump not guilty. The White House team reiterated their arguments that the allegations by the House — that Trump abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine and obstructed Congress’ investigation into his actions — don’t rise to the level of impeachable offenses. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow claimed that the revelations from John Bolton’s manuscript – that Trump tied the withholding of military aid to Ukraine to investigations into his political rivals – were “inadmissible” and that “[Impeachment] is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts.” Rep. Adam Schiff, the House’s lead impeachment manager, suggested that Trump’s own lawyers made an “effective” case for why the Senate should call Bolton as a witness. And, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump’s lawyers “showed how weak their case was” and that “Their whole argument is diversion.”</p>

<p><strong>What happened Saturday?</strong> Trump’s legal team began their opening arguments by seeking to cast doubt on Democrats’ case that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden. Over the course of a two-hour session, Trump’s lawyer Pat Cipollone and his deputy Michael Purpura argued that Trump had valid reasons for withholding military aid from Ukraine and that House prosecutors overlooked facts, noting that witnesses in the House’s impeachment hearings based their assessments on “presumptions” and “guesswork” rather than knowledge of Trump’s intentions. “We don’t believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they’re asking you to do,” Cipollone said. They also argued that the words Trump spoke on his July 25 call to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, conveyed no pressure — and that Ukrainians never publicly expressed any. Cipollone added that Democrats are “asking you to tear up all of the ballots all across the country” and “perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history.”</p>

<p><strong>What happened today?</strong> Trump’s team continued with their opening statements, arguing about the basis of the House’s impeachment inquiry and the Trump’s rights of due process and executive privilege. Trump’s lawyers – ignoring John Bolton’s disclosure that Trump said he wanted to continue a freeze on military aid to Ukraine until officials helped with investigations into Trump’s political rivals – told senators that no evidence existed tying Trump’s decision to withhold security aid from Ukraine to his insistence on the investigations, arguing that Trump did nothing wrong and the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate from the start. Alan Dershowitz claimed that “Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power, or an impeachable offense.” A handful of Republicans, meanwhile, appeared to be moving closer to joining Democrats in a vote to subpoena Bolton. Pam Bondi, one of Trump’s lawyers, accused Democrats of denying the legitimacy of investigations into the Bidens because the House case depends on the premise that Trump was only interested in the negative political impact on his rival. Jane Raskin, a member of Trump’s defense team, also called Rudy Giuliani a “colorful distraction.”</p>

<p><strong>Trump told former national security adviser John Bolton in August that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until Ukrainian officials helped with investigations into Biden</strong> and other Democrats, according to an unpublished manuscript of Bolton’s forthcoming book,  <a href="https://amzn.to/36zod6u">“The Room Where It Happened.”</a> Bolton’s account directly contradicts one of Trump’s defense arguments, that there was no quid pro quo when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in the July phone call. Bolton’s account was included in drafts of a manuscript he circulated to close associates. A draft was also sent to the White House for a standard review process on Dec. 30 — 12 days after Trump was impeached. The White House ordered Bolton and other key officials with firsthand knowledge of Trump’s dealings not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.

<p><strong>Congressional Democrats called for Bolton to testify in Trump’s impeachment trial</strong> following the report that Trump told Bolton last August that he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless it aided investigations into the Bidens. In a joint statement, the seven House impeachment managers called the report “explosive” and urged Senate Republicans to agree to call Bolton as a witness in Trump’s trial. Bolton has said that he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that because of the report that Bolton had firsthand knowledge of Trump’s decision that ran counter to the White House’s account, the “refusal of the Senate to call for him, other relevant witnesses, and documents is now even more indefensible.” (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-call-for-bolton-to-testify-in-trump-impeachment-trial-after-new-report-on-aid-to-ukraine/2020/01/26/de234402-409a-11ea-b503-2b077c436617_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/democrats-demand-bolton-testimony-after-report-his-book-says-trump-n1123491">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.axios.com/john-bolton-testimony-trump-impeachment-trial-853e86b0-cc70-4ac6-9e5f-a8da07e7ac93.html">Axios</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defense-team-to-present-arguments-following-boltons-800-pound-gorilla-11580132745">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>

<p><strong>House managers used their final day of opening arguments to conclude their presentation on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power</strong>. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Trump “did exactly what our framers feared most: He invited foreign interference in our elections and sold out our country’s security for his personal benefit, and betrayed the nation’s trust to a foreign power.” Impeachment manager Jason Crow added that the hold on the aid “wasn’t lifted for any legitimate reason. It was only lifted because President Trump had gotten caught.” Impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, using witness testimony from the House proceedings, detailed what he called a “failed” effort to “coverup” Trump’s attempt to “cheat” in the 2020 election. Jeffries said the White House “tried to bury” the summary of Trump’s July 25 call on a secure server because it was politically damaging, adding that the military aid was released only “after the House launched an investigation and after Congress learned about the existence of a whistleblower complaint.”</p>

<p><strong>House managers then moved on to the second article of impeachment, Trump’s alleged obstruction of Congress</strong> by directing witnesses not to testify and refusing to allow the release of documents. Impeachment manager Val Demings called Trump’s refusal to cooperate “categorical, indiscriminate and historically unprecedented.” She added that under “Trump’s orders, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense all continued to refuse to produce a single document or record in response to 71 specific requests, including five subpoenas.” Further, Demings characterized “Trump’s attacks on whistleblowers and witnesses” who testified the House probe as “witness intimidation.” Impeachment manager Sylvia Garcia added that Trump had “orchestrated a cover-up” in “plain sight” and “should be removed.” Zoe Lofgren, another House impeachment managers, compared Trump to Nixon, saying “Not only did Nixon allow his staff to testify before Congress, he publicly directed them to testify without demanding a subpoena.” And, finally, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler called Trump “a dictator” during his presentation, arguing that Trump is “the first and only president ever to declare himself unaccountable.” In his closing remarks, Schiff warned that a failure to remove Trump for obstructing Congress would inflict “an unending injury to this country” because “the balance of power that our founders set out will never be the same.”</p>

<p><strong>Trump complained that his impeachment defense “will be forced to start on Saturday,” which he called “Death Valley in T.V.”</strong> Saturday’s impeachment session will begin at 10 a.m. and will last for several hours. The White House wanted to present some arguments on Saturday to rebut three days of charges from Democrats and to provide fodder for Sunday shows. Trump’s defense team plans to save the bulk of its arguments for Monday and Tuesday, when viewers will be more tuned in. Trump also complained that it is “wrong” for House managers to use “ALL of their” allotted time for opening arguments.

<p><strong>Trump’s Senate Impeachment Trial</strong>: Senators reconvened in the Capitol for the third day of Trump’s impeachment trial with House impeachment managers making their case to both senators and the American people that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine for his own personal gain while hurting the national interest. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said “The charges set forth in the first article of impeachment are firmly grounded in the Constitution of the United States,” and that “No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections.” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff added that Trump “is a president who truly feels that he can do whatever he wants.” Schiff concluded the day by urging senators to asked whether they believed that Trump would put the nation’s interests before his own, saying “If you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because the truth matters. Otherwise, we are lost.” Democrats have used their 24 hours of opening arguments to target a small group of Senate Republicans they hope will cross the aisle and vote with them to issue subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney have hinted they could be open to the possibility of calling witnesses. Trump, meanwhile, is reportedly “very pleased” with how the trial is going and is eager to prove “he’s done nothing wrong.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/politics/democrats-trump-impeachment-trial.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/long-way-to-go-as-opening-impeachment-arguments-enter-second-day-11579777201?mod=article_inline">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/politics/trump-impeachment-hearing-today.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/23/trump-impeachment-defense-102944">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-23/house-democrats-focus-on-constitutional-case-against-trump">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/politics/senate-impeachment-trial-day-3/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>

<p><strong>House Democratic managers began formal arguments in Trump’s  Senate impeachment trial, presenting the case for convicting Trump and removing him from office on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress</strong>. During opening arguments, House managers outlined how “Trump solicited foreign inference” to “cheat” by abusing “the powers of his office” and “seeking help from abroad to improve his reelection prospects at home.” And, when Trump “was caught, he used the powers of that office to obstruct the investigation into his own misconduct.” Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump’s efforts to get a foreign government to announce an investigation into his political rival “a gross abuse of power,” urging Republicans to “protect our democracy” by joining Democrats in voting to remove Trump from office. Throughout the day, Schiff and impeachment managers methodically outlined Trump’s “corrupt scheme and cover-up,” calling on Senators to “decide what kind of democracy […] we ought to be” and what Americans can expect “in the conduct of their president.” Schiff closed the day by rehashing the facts of the case as presented over the last eight hours, urging senators to learn the “full truth” and warning that the “truth is going to come out.” (<a href="https://apnews.com/29b81fda30045ec649467abb7ee47d28">Associated Press</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/politics/impeachment-case-trump.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/house-to-begin-presenting-case-to-remove-trump-from-office">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-set-to-begin-opening-arguments-in-senate-impeachment-trial-11579690802">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-s-senate-impeachment-trial-what-happened-day-2-n1120576">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/22/democrats-trump-impeachment-case-102504">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/22/senate-impeachment-trial-opening-arguments-witnesses-102065">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-trial-live-updates/2020/01/22/3beb411e-3d05-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/live-trump-impeachment-senate-trial-coverage-n1119061">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-impeachment-trial-01-22-20/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-impeachment-trial">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/more-sparring-likely-before-house-makes-case-impeachment-update">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/22/senate-impeachment-trial-live-highlights-and-updates-102046">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jan/22/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-news-today-senate-live">The Guardian</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump said he’s open to new witnesses at his impeachment trial, before immediately backtracking</strong>. At a news conference in Davos, Trump suggested he’d prefer his impeachment trial to go the “long way” with testimony from a “a lot of people,” including former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and his acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Trump then dismissed the idea, saying it could never happen because it would create “a national security problem” and that testimony by Bolton in particular could hurt his presidency, because “you don’t want someone testifying who didn’t leave on the best of terms.” The White House instructed many witnesses, including Bolton, not to testify in the House inquiry.

<p><strong>The Office of Management and Budget released 192 pages of documents related to the withholding of Ukraine military aid</strong>, “including records that have not been produced to Congress in its impeachment investigation.” The night before Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy, emails show that OMB officials shared a “Ukraine Prep Memo” with Michael Duffey, a political appointee who played a role in Trump’s move to freeze the aid. That same evening, it appears the general counsel’s office prepared a footnote for budget officials – a mechanism officials at the budget office used to pause the funding. The documents also detail communications between Duffey and other OMB aides, including Mark Sandy and Paul Denaro, discussing the details on the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative in the emails — dated from early August to Sept. 30. Emails from acting OMB Director Russell Vought are also included.

<p><strong>The first day of Trump’s impeachment trial began with more than 12 hours of contentious debate over the procedural rules that will guide the proceedings as senators repeatedly voted along party lines to reject efforts to subpoena new witnesses</strong>. Senate Republicans rejected 11 Democratic amendments to subpoena records from the White House, State Department, Defense Department, and the Office of Management and Budget related to Ukraine, which the White House blocked during the House inquiry. Senate Republicans also blocked amendments to issue subpoenas for testimony from John Bolton, the former national security adviser, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, Michael Duffey, a White House budget office official, and Robert Blair, a Mulvaney adviser who was involved in the decision to freeze military aid to Ukraine. Even an attempt to make a deal to shorten debate was rejected. At one point, Chief Justice John Roberts admonished the prosecutors and the White House legal team for the quality of their discourse, warning them about using inappropriate language. The Senate adopted Mitch McConnell’s proposed rules for Trump’s impeachment trial after more than 12 hours of debate and discussion over the rules.

<p><strong>Mitch McConnell made last-minute, handwritten changes to the proposed impeachment trial rules following criticism from Democrats and key Republicans</strong>. McConnell initially circulated the proposed organizing resolution late Monday night, which would have provided House impeachment managers and Trump’s legal team each 24 hours over two days to make their opening arguments. McConnell’s proposal would have also put the decision of whether to admit the House evidence to a Senate vote. Following complaints from lawmakers, however, McConnell revised the resolution, instead giving House prosecutors and White House lawyers each 24 hours over three days to present their opening arguments, as well as a provision to automatically enter evidence collected during the House impeachment inquiry. The change means the trial days, which start at 1 p.m., will likely now conclude daily around 9 p.m. – instead of after midnight. The condensed timeline also raises the prospect that the trial will conclude before Trump’s Feb. 4 State of the Union address.

<p><strong>Trump added celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Ken Starr to his Senate impeachment trial defense team</strong>. Starr investigated Bill Clinton, and Dershowitz’s past clients include Jeffrey Epstein and O.J. Simpson. The team will be led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, and Starr’s successor at the Office of Independent Counsel during the Clinton administration, Robert Ray. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump’s longtime personal counsel Jane Raskin will also supplement the impeachment team.

<p><strong>The Senate opened the impeachment trial of Trump – the third presidential impeachment trial in history</strong> – with the swearing in of senators and the presentation of the two charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, administered the oath to “do impartial justice” to all senators in the chamber. The Senate also issued a formal summons for Trump, informing him of the charges and inviting him to respond by Saturday evening. The Senate will now recess the trial until Tuesday, Jan. 21. A two-thirds vote is required to remove Trump from office, meaning 20 Republican senators would need to break ranks. Trump, meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1217909231946477575">tweeted</a>: “I JUST GOT IMPEACHED FOR MAKING A PERFECT PHONE CALL!” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/16/mcconnell-pelosi-impeachment-articles-pens-099709">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-trial-live-updates/2020/01/16/bfb641d6-37d5-11ea-bf30-ad313e4ec754_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/politics/senate-impeachment-trial-starts/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-to-be-sworn-in-as-trump-impeachment-trial-begins-11579177831">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jan/16/trump-impeachment-trial-live-news-ukraine-pelosi-giuliani-latest-updates-senate-democrats">The Guardian</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The House will vote on Wednesday to transmit articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate</strong>. “The American people deserve the truth, and the Constitution demands a trial,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

<p><strong>The Russian military hacked into the Ukrainian gas company at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry</strong>. Using similar tactics to those used to obtain emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the DNC, Russian hackers employed phishing emails to steal usernames and passwords from Burisma employees. It is still unclear what the hackers found or what they were looking for, but experts say the timing and scale of the attack suggest that they could be searching for information about the Bidens. The hacking attempts began in early November while reports about the Bidens, Ukraine, and impeachment were leading the news in the U.S. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-burisma-ukraine.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/russian-spies-hacked-ukrainian-energy-company-center-trump-s-impeachment-n1114906">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-spies-hacked-ukrainian-gas-company-at-heart-of-trump-impeachment-trial/2020/01/13/db50b2b0-366c-11ea-bb7b-265f4554af6d_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Mitch McConnell told Republicans he has the votes needed to begin Trump’s impeachment trial without committing to calling new witnesses or admitting new evidence</strong>, rebuffing demands from Democrats.

<p><strong>Former national security adviser John Bolton said he is “prepared to testify” in Trump’s impeachment trial if subpoenaed by the Senate</strong>. Bolton, who so far has complied with a White House directive to not cooperate in the inquiry, has direct knowledge of Trump’s actions and conversations regarding Ukraine that could fill in blanks in the impeachment case. A Senate subpoena requires at least 51 votes, which means four Republicans would need to vote with Democrats to call a witness.

<p><strong>Trump called for a quick end to the impeachment process, tweeting to “get this done.”</strong> Trump’s tweet came shortly before Bolton’s announcement. The House passed two articles of impeachment against Trump last month, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to formally transmit the charges to Senate – a requirement before the Senate can hold a trial. Pelosi has been holding the documents as Democrats seek guarantees about the scope of a Senate trial, including witnesses.

Murkowski said McConnell has “confused the process” by declaring that he is acting in “total coordination” with Trump to set the parameters of the trial. “To me,” she continued, “it means that we have to take that step back from being hand in glove with the defense.” Murkowski, a moderate Republican, did not say how she will vote in the upcoming trial.

<p><strong>A White House budget official directed the Defense Department to “hold off” on sending military aid to Ukraine less than two hours after Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, according to newly released emails. Roughly 90 minutes after Trump’s call with Zelensky, Michael Duffey, a senior budget official, told Pentagon officials that Trump was personally interested in the Ukraine aid and had ordered the hold himself. Duffey also told the Pentagon to keep the information “closely held to those who need to know to execute the direction” due to “the sensitive nature of the request.” The emails show Trump first became interested in the aid to Ukraine after seeing an article in the Washington Examiner on June 19 titled, “Pentagon to send $250M in weapons to Ukraine,” and that some officials were concerned that withholding the aid could be a violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Democrats are citing the emails to fuel renewed calls for witnesses to testify in the Senate impeachment trial.

<p><strong>Mitch McConnell suggested that Republicans had not ruled out hearing witnesses at Trump’s impeachment trial, but wouldn’t agree in advance to the Democrat’s request for witness testimony</strong>. In a bid to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an agreement with Chuck Schumer on trial rules, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hasn’t transmitted the Senate the impeachment articles necessary to begin the trial, saying Democrats need to know “what sort of trial the Senate will conduct.” McConnell, meanwhile, called Pelosi’s position “absurd,” adding that he’s at an “impasse” with Schumer on the rules of the trial.

<p><strong>The White House is considering making the argument that Trump has not officially been impeached because Pelosi has not transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate</strong>. Officials plan to use the delay to argue that the Democrats have little faith in their own case for impeachment and are scared to trigger a trial they know they will lose. Officials also say Trump, while “angry” about what he views as an unfair process, is actually in a “very good mood,” and feels confident he can win the messaging war via Twitter.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee said it could draft and recommend “new articles of impeachment” against Trump if additional evidence is revealed by former White House counsel Don McGahn</strong>. The committee wants a federal appeals court to order McGahn to testify as it examines potential obstruction of justice by Trump during Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. McGahn’s testimony is “relevant to the Committee’s ongoing investigations into Presidential misconduct and consideration of whether to recommend additional articles of impeachment,” the panel’s lawyers said, arguing that McGahn’s testimony is a “central” part of the impeachment investigation into Trump. Democrats have been trying for months to enforce a subpoena for McGahn to testify as part of the impeachment proceedings in Congress.

Senior Democratic aides suggested it was “very unlikely” that the House will send the articles to the Senate before January, effectively delaying the impeachment trial well into the new year, in order to pressure Republicans to allow new witnesses and evidence in the proceeding. “We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side,” Pelosi said. “So far we haven’t seen anything that looks fair to us.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/us/politics/impeachment-trump-senate-trial.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-sending-impeachment-articles-senate-sees-details-trial/story?id=67824327">ABC News</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/19/pelosi-withhold-impeachment-articles-senate-087936">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/18/politics/nancy-pelosi-sending-impeachment-articles-senate/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/pelosi-says-house-will-wait-send-impeachment-articles-senate-clarity-n1104741">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/19/0b2d8c0c-21fe-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-house-impeaches-trump-timing-of-next-steps-is-unclear-11576755097">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-19/mcconnell-trump-blast-pelosi-over-possible-impeachment-delay">Bloomberg</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump for abusing his power and obstructing congressional investigations</strong>, labeling him a threat to national security, recommending his removal from office, and marking him as only the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. After six hours of debate, the chamber passed both articles of impeachment against Trump. Article I, Abuse of Power, was adopted 230-197, with one member voting present and three not voting. Article II, Obstruction of Congress, was adopted 229-198, with one member voting present and three not voting. The Constitution requires the Senate to now hold a trial, where a two-thirds vote would remove Trump from office. The House alleges that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, as well as a probe of a debunked theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened debate on the articles of impeachment against Trump, declaring that lawmakers are “custodians of the Constitution” and “If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty.” She added that Trump’s “reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-is-impeached-by-the-house-creating-an-indelible-mark-on-his-presidency/2019/12/18/501bcab2-2105-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/18/trump-impeachment-wednesday-house-vote-086512">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-19/trump-impeached-by-u-s-house-on-abuse-of-power-charge">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-prepares-to-vote-on-impeaching-trump-11576667768">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-impeached-house-abuse-power-n1104196">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/18/politics/house-impeachment-vote/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-inches-closer-historic-impeachment-vote-rules-committee/story?id=67766943">ABC News</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump sent 45 tweets before noon – hours before the House formally voted to impeach him – calling impeachment “a terrible Thing”</strong> and telling his 67 million Twitter followers “Can you believe that I will be impeached today […] I DID NOTHING WRONG!” At one point Trump urged his followers to “Say a PRAYER!” Meanwhile, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters that Trump “will be working all day” and that he “could catch some of the proceedings between meetings.” Less than 10 minutes later, Trump tweeted: “SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!” Trump ignored reporters’ questions about impeachment as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Michigan.

<p><strong>The White House is exploring a way to feature Trump’s top House allies in the Senate impeachment trial</strong>. During the trial, only Trump’s defense team and the House Democrats’ impeachment managers will be allowed to debate on the floor. One idea being explored is to have House Republicans present a report on the Ukraine affair. Reps. Jim Jordan, John Ratcliffe, and Mike Johnson met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone yesterday to discuss joining Trump’s Senate defense team. Mark Meadows is also being considered to join the team, but wasn’t present for the meeting.

Some legal scholars have suggested that Pelosi could delay sending impeachment articles to the Senate until Mitch McConnell agrees to a fairer process. The trial would effectively be delayed indefinitely and deny Trump his expected acquittal. McConnell has announced that he is coordinating the Senate trial with the White House.

McConnell called the request to have Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, and two others to testify a “strange request” and said the Senate will not volunteer its time for a “fishing expedition.” McConnell’s remarks came in response to a letter from Chuck Schumer, who outlined several procedural requests that he said would make an impeachment trial more fair. McConnell later said he’s “not an impartial juror […] I’m not impartial about this at all.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mcconnell-rejects-democrats-call-for-new-witnesses-in-senate-impeachment-trial/2019/12/17/dbdc326a-20e9-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/17/mcconnell-rejects-schumers-opening-offer-on-impeachment-trial-086433">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.axios.com/mitch-mcconnell-senate-impeachment-trial-chuck-schumer-5fe8ffed-0a9f-412b-b4a4-abc7cad04b48.html">Axios</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-17/house-panel-to-set-rules-for-debate-vote-impeachment-update">Bloomberg</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump denounced what he called a “partisan impeachment crusade,” accusing Democrats of “perversion of justice” for their handling of impeachment</strong>. In a six-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump accused Pelosi of having “cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment” and that she was “declaring open war on American Democracy” by pursuing his impeachment. He called it an “unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power” and a “spiteful” “election-nullification scheme.” Trump also claimed that “more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.” Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office that he takes “zero” responsibility for the fact that he is about to be impeached.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee accused Trump of “multiple federal crimes” and argued that Trump “betrayed the nation by abusing his high office.”</strong> The 658-page report labels Trump’s behavior “both constitutional and criminal in character” and recommends two articles of impeachment: abuse of power for holding up nearly $400 million worth of security aid and a White House meeting until Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into Biden and 2016 election interference, and obstruction of Congress, saying “Trump’s obstruction of Congress does not befit the leader of a democratic society. It calls to mind the very claims of royal privilege against which our founders rebelled.” The House is expected to vote Wednesday on whether to impeach Trump.

McConnell added that it “wouldn’t surprise” him if some Democrats broke ranks to vote in favor of Trump, calling the case “so darn weak.” McConnell and the White House have agreed to coordinate their plans for the trial, which McConnell has said he will end as soon as he has 51 GOP votes in place for a final vote. “We know how it’s going to end.” (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/mcconnell-there-s-no-chance-trump-removed-office-n1101286">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/senate-impeachment-trial-mitch-mcconnell-white-house/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/mcconnell-says-hell-let-trumps-white-house-dictate-trumps-impeachment-trial/">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Rudy Giuliani was seen entering the White House just as the House Judiciary Committee voted to approve articles of impeachment against Trump</strong>. Giuliani – unfazed by federal prosecutors probing his business dealings and the Trump impeachment inquiry – has escalated his push for Ukraine to conduct investigations. He recently traveled to Ukraine to interview officials and gather more information and has promised to create a “report” on the findings of his trip. It was not clear if Giuliani was meeting with Trump.

<p><strong>More than $20 million of the military aid that was supposed to go to Ukraine still hasn’t reached the country</strong>. $20.2 million of the Pentagon’s $250-million portion of the aid is still sitting in U.S. accounts, undermining one of the key GOP arguments against impeachment: that Ukraine eventually received the aid despite the hold placed on it by the Trump administration. Letters from lawmakers to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other officials asking about the continued delay have gone unanswered.

<p><strong>After more than 14 hours of impeachment debate, the House Judiciary Committee abruptly postponed an expected party line vote on whether to approve articles of impeachment against Trump</strong>. The committee will now reconvene Friday at 10 a.m. ET to vote. Lawmakers spent the day debating the articles and multiple proposed Republican amendments intended to gut the impeachment resolution – including an amendment to remove charging Trump with abuse of power – which were all rebuffed in one vote after another. The panel, however, is expected to eventually approve two articles of impeachment against Trump: a charge that Trump abused the powers of his office by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals while withholding U.S. security aid and a White House meeting; and a charge of obstructing Congress for refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry into his conduct and for failure to respond to congressional subpoenas. Trump would become the fourth president in American history to face impeachment by the House for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Once the Judiciary votes, the full House is expected to debate and vote on the articles next week with a trial set to begin in the Senate in early 2020 – about 10 months before the next election.

<p><strong>Senate Republicans are pushing for a short impeachment trial that would include calling zero witnesses</strong>. The plan contradicts Trump’s desire to stage a theatrical trial with public defense of his conduct by calling “a lot of witnesses,” including Joe and Hunter Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and the anonymous whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky served as the catalyst for the impeachment inquiry. Mitch McConnell is also expected to hold a final vote to acquit Trump, instead of holding a vote on dismissing the articles of impeachment.

<p><strong>Trump sent more than 100 tweets and retweets insisting that he committed “no crime” and “did nothing wrong,” while calling the impeachment inquiry “Crazy!”</strong> Trump also took time to promote Mar-a-Lago opening for the season, proclaiming: “I will be there in two weeks, The Southern White House!” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/12/donald-trump-impeachment-083517">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-hours-vote-impeachment-vote-says-no-crime-crazy-n1100546">NBC News</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee introduced two articles of impeachment against Trump</strong>, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of the impeachment inquiry. The articles – written in a nine-page resolution – accuse Trump of having “abused the powers of the presidency by ignoring and injuring national security” to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival and that Trump then engaged in “complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry” by directing the White House and other agencies to withhold documents and block officials from cooperating with the inquiry. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said Trump betrayed the country and his oath of office, engaged in a “cover up” of his own misconduct, and “ignored and injured the interests of the nation.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump tried to “corrupt our upcoming elections” and that he remains a “threat to our democracy and national security.” Trump, meanwhile, insisted that he did “NOTHING” wrong and that impeaching him would be an act of “sheer Political Madness!” The Judiciary panel will take up the articles of impeachment later this week with a full House vote likely next week, setting Trump up to become the third president to be impeached. The impeachment trial will be held in the Senate, where the Republican majority is expected to acquit him. Nadler added: “We must be clear: no one, not even the president, is above the law.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/trump-impeachment-articles.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/10/7b3c093c-1b38-11ea-b4c1-fd0d91b60d9e_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/10/democrats-ready-reveal-of-articles-of-impeachment-079950">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-democrats-announce-two-articles-of-impeachment-11575987219">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-10/democrats-to-impeach-trump-for-abuse-of-power-obstruction">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/10/politics/impeachment-articles-announced/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/house-democrats-unveil-two-articles-impeachment-charge-trump-high-crimes-n1098846">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/10/donald-trump-articles-of-impeachment-democrats-congress">The Guardian</a> / <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-unveil-articles-impeachment-president-trump-tuesday-sources/story?id=67614092">ABC News</a> / <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/10/786569843/house-democrats-expected-to-unveil-articles-of-impeachment-tuesday">NPR</a> / <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/u-s-democrats-unveil-impeachment-charges-against-trump-idUSKBN1YE17R">Reuters</a> / <a href="https://apnews.com/bb81279725b6f810d5792502254f2f88">Associated Press</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump and Mitch McConnell are divided over the Senate impeachment trial</strong>. McConnell hopes to end the trial as quickly as possible.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee held its last hearing before considering articles of impeachment</strong>. Lawyers for Democrats and Republicans presented the case for – and against – impeaching Trump. Democrats described four “critical” findings: 1/ Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine’s newly-elected president to interfere in the 2020 presidential election for his personal and political benefit; 2/ Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and withheld military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden; 3/ Trump’s conduct undermined the U.S. election process; 4/ Trump directed an effort to obstruct Congress’ impeachment inquiry into his conduct.  A lawyer for the Democrats called “Trump’s persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security.” The Republican counsel, meanwhile, accused Democrats of pursuing an “artificial and arbitrary political deadline” to overturn the 2016 election and impeach Trump’s before the Christmas holiday. The Judiciary Committee is expected to publicly debate and compose final versions of articles of impeachment as soon as Thursday, with a full House vote next week.

<p><strong>More than 500 legal scholars signed an open letter asserting that Trump committed “impeachable conduct.”</strong> The group noted that Trump’s attempt at affecting the results of the 2020 election was not a matter that could be left to voters at the polls. “Put simply, if a President cheats in his effort at re-election, trusting the democratic process to serve as a check through that election is no remedy at all,” the professors wrote. “That is what impeachment is for.” (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/more-than-500-law-professors-say-trump-committed-impeachable-conduct/2019/12/06/35259c16-183a-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The White House rejected an invitation to participate in Monday’s impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee</strong>. In a sharply worded letter, the White House called the process “completely baseless” and “a reckless abuse of power” by the Democrats, who “should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings.” Trump had until 5 p.m. ET to decided whether to have his lawyers participate in the remaining House Judiciary Committee impeachment proceedings. Lawyers for the House Intelligence Committee are expected to present findings on Monday from the 300-page report that concluded Trump put his personal political interest above the national interest.

<p><strong>Speaker Nancy Pelosi instructed the key chairmen in the House of Representatives to begin drafting impeachment articles against Trump</strong>, signaling that the House will likely vote to charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors before Christmas. Pelosi said the facts of Trump’s alleged wrongdoing involving Ukraine “are uncontested” and that “the president leaves us no choice but to act.” By ordering the “chairmen” to draft the charges, Pelosi left open the possibility that the other five committees that have investigated Trump and his administration will be asked to make recommendations about articles of impeachment. Pelosi added that Trump “abused his power for his own personal political benefit” and that his alleged wrongdoing “strikes at the very heart of our Constitution.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/politics/pelosi-impeachment.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/05/pelosi-reveals-plan-to-proceed-with-articles-of-impeachment-against-trump-076173">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/pelosi-make-statement-impeachment-n1096341">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-make-formal-statement-impeachment-inquiry/story?id=67514548">ABC News</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/house-speaker-announcement-congress/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pelosi-to-deliver-statement-on-status-of-impeachment-inquiry-11575551142">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/12/05/af436c7a-174b-11ea-9110-3b34ce1d92b1_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/pelosi-says-house-will-draft-impeachment-articles-against-trump?srnd=premium">Bloomberg</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump committed impeachable offenses, according to three constitutional scholars who testified during the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment hearing</strong> into Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine for political gain. Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard, Michael Gerhardt, a professor at the University of North Carolina, and Pamela Karlan, a Stanford law professor, all agreed that Trump was guilty of “high crimes and misdemeanors” for soliciting foreign assistance and withholding a White House meeting and military assistance from Ukraine as leverage for political favors. Gerhardt added that Trump’s actions toward Ukraine were worse than Richard Nixon’s misconduct during Watergate. Karlan also told lawmakers that Trump’s attempt to “strong arm a foreign leader” would not be considered politics as usual. Feldman, Gerhardt, and Karlan were invited to testify by the Democrats. Republicans also tapped their own law professor, Jonathan Turley, to testify, who suggested that the impeachment case is “slipshod” and premature. Turley also disagreed that Trump conditioning a White House meeting and releasing military aid on whether Ukraine would announce the investigations he wanted amounted to a bribe.

<p><strong>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler suggested that Democrats could link Mueller’s findings to the House’s impeachment inquiry</strong>. Nadler’s opening statement outlined how Trump met both the Mueller investigation and the Ukraine probe with “obstruction.” Nadler added that “Trump welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election,” “demanded it for the 2020 election,” and “In both cases, he got caught. And in both cases, he did everything in his power to prevent the American people from learning the truth about his conduct.” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/04/trump-impeachment-next-phase-removal-075013">Politico</a>)</p>

Giuliani traveled to Budapest to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, before going to Ukraine to meet with a number of other former prosecutors, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk. It was Giuliani’s earlier interactions with some of the same Ukrainians  that setup the impeachment inquiry in the first place and led to an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether Giuliani violated federal lobbying laws.

<p><strong>The House Intelligence Committee concluded that Trump tried to “use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.”</strong> The 300-page impeachment report also asserts that Trump “placed his own personal and political interests”  ahead of U.S. national interests, “subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential re-election campaign.” The report continues that “This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election presents a clear and present danger that the president will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.”  The Intelligence Committee is expected to approve the report along party lines Tuesday evening, ahead of the first impeachment hearing in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

<p><strong>House Democrats are considering expanding their articles of impeachment to include charges beyond Trump’s alleged abuse of power related to Ukraine</strong>. Some members of the Judiciary Committee have discussed drafting articles for obstruction of justice and other “high crimes” outlined in the Mueller report, as well as allegations that Trump has used the presidency to personally enrich himself. Others on the committee support a more narrow approach that focuses solely on Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into his political opponents.

<p><strong>House Republicans prepared their own report, which claims Trump did “nothing wrong” and committed “no quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power.”</strong> The 123-page rebuttal report claims Trump was acting on “genuine and reasonable” skepticism of Ukraine and had “valid” concerns about corruption – not political self-interest – when he pressured Ukraine to open investigations to benefit his 2020 re-election bid by withholding nearly $400 million in security assistance and a White House meeting. Republicans called the move “entirely prudent.” The report, however, does not acknowledge any wrongdoing surrounding the core allegations in the impeachment inquiry and ignores or downplays testimony from career officials who raised serious questions and concerns about the conduct of Trump and his top aides.

<p><strong>Impeachment Watch: What happens next.</strong> The House Intelligence Committee concluded public hearings for the impeachment inquiry into Trump after more than a dozen witnesses testified. With no other witnesses scheduled to testify, the committee and Chair Adam Schiff will now compile and submit a report of its findings to the House Judiciary Committee. The report will be sent to the Judiciary Committee, which will decide whether or not to draft on articles of impeachment. If it drafts articles, the committee would vote on them and send them to the House floor, where Democrats anticipate a vote by Christmas. If the House votes to impeach Trump, the case is sent to the Senate for a trial, which would start in the new year. It would require a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to remove Trump from office. Senate Republicans and senior White House officials have discussed limiting a Senate impeachment trial to two weeks. Meanwhile, a federal judge is expected to rule on whether former White House counsel Don McGahn is required to obey a Judiciary Committee subpoena to testify in response to an earlier House subpoena in a previous matter. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton declined an invitation to testify and has not been subpoenaed, but said he won’t testify unless compelled by a court. Bolton is awaiting the result of a lawsuit filed by his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, asking a judge to decide whether he should listen to the House or the White House.

<p><strong>Trump spent 53 minutes on the phone with “Fox &amp; Friends” accusing an impeachment witness of lying</strong>, repeating a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, and calling the details in the whistleblower complaint “fake.” Trump accused David Holmes, a political counselor to the American ambassador in Ukraine, of fabricating a phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, saying “I guarantee you that never took place.” Sondland, however, corroborated Holmes’s account in his own testimony. Trump also accused the Obama administration of spying on his campaign, claiming that “they were spying on my campaign and it went right to the top and everybody knows it and now we’re going to find out” and “they tried to overthrow the presidency.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-interview.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-fox-and-friends-call-impeachment-ukraine-e1739c65-33d3-4c35-a723-7a31abb488ef.html">Axios</a> / <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-fox-and-friends_n_5dd7eaeae4b00149f71b3a6c?6at">HuffPost</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The former White House adviser on Russia opened her testimony before the impeachment inquiry by accusing Republican lawmakers of weaponizing “falsehoods” with the “fictional narrative” that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election</strong>. Fiona Hill called Rep. Devin Nunes attempts to sow doubt that Russia interfered in the election a myth “perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services.” She added that it’s “beyond dispute” that “Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions” in 2016. Hill and foreign service officer David Holmes appeared together as public impeachment witnesses, testifying about efforts by Gordon Sondland and Rudy Giuliani to convince Ukraine’s president to announce investigations that would benefit Trump politically around the time Trump froze security aid to Ukraine. Hill testified that she warned Sondland at the time that his efforts in Ukraine on behalf of Trump would “blow up.” She added: “And here we are.” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/21/impeachment-hearings-close-fiona-hill-072347">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fiona-hill-to-testify-in-impeachment-inquiry-about-a-fictional-narrative-on-ukrainian-interference/2019/11/21/6d1fe576-0c60-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/politics/fiona-hill-david-holmes-public-impeachment-hearing/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/diplomat-describes-confusion-in-ukraine-over-giuliani-s-role">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/impeachment-hearings-day-five.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiona-hill-david-holmes-expected-to-testify-on-ukraine-pressure-campaign-11574332203">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/fiona-hill-say-partisan-politics-drove-fictional-narrative-ukraine-n1088221">NBC News</a>)</p>

<p><strong>White House officials and Senate Republicans agreed that a full trial should be conducted if the House impeaches Trump</strong>. The White House reportedly wants Trump’s GOP allies in the Senate to hold a trial, but limit it to about two weeks as a way of showing a commitment to due process. Three Republicans, however, can block any impeachment vote on the Senate floor. Trump, meanwhile, is reportedly “miserable” about the ongoing impeachment inquiry and has pushed to dismiss the proceedings outright.

<p><strong>The U.S. ambassador to the European Union testified that he and senior administration officials “followed the president’s orders” to work with Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations</strong> into Joe Biden and the discredited conspiracy theory that the country helped Democrats in the 2016 election. Gordon Sondland testified that he, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and special envoy Kurt Volker coordinated with Giuliani at the “at the express direction of the president of the United States” to pressure Ukraine into launching the investigations. Sondland also said he directly communicated the “quid pro quo” arrangement to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Additionally, Sondland provided House impeachment investigators with emails and texts showing that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Perry, and others were all aware that Trump conditioned a White House meeting for Zelensky on his willingness to launch the investigations. “They knew what we were doing and why,” Sondland said. “Everyone was in the loop.

<p><strong>Two national security officials testified publicly that Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president was “improper,” “unusual,” and overtly political</strong>. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, an adviser to Mike Pence on Russia and Europe, both listened in on Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump ignored official talking points about fighting corruption to instead “demand” an investigation tied to Joe Biden. Vindman told the House Intelligence Committee that “What I heard was inappropriate and I reported it […] out of a sense of duty,” because “the connection to investigate a political opponent was inappropriate and improper.” Vindman also testified that he interpreted Trump’s request that Zelensky open investigations as a demand, saying “the power disparity between the two leaders – my impression was that in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelensky would have to deliver these investigations.” In her opening statement, Williams said she found the call “unusual” because it “involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.” Vindman and Williams are the first White House officials to testify in public as part of the impeachment inquiry.

Bill Taylor told the House Intelligence Committee that a member of his staff overheard Trump mention “the investigations” to Sondland, and that “Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.” Taylor called Trump’s decision to withhold “security assistance in exchange for help” with investigations to benefit his personal political interests both “alarming” and “crazy,” because Ukraine is a “strategic partner” and supporting them against Russian aggression is “clearly in our national interest.” Taylor also testified that “Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden” than Ukraine.

<p><strong>A senior defense official told House impeachment investigators that Trump directed the mid-July freeze in military aid to Ukraine through the Office of Management and Budget</strong>. Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, said she attended a meeting on July 23, where “this issue” of Trump’s “concerns about Ukraine and Ukraine security assistance” were shared by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Cooper also told House impeachment investigators that she discussed the frozen aid with Kurt Volker, the then-U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, on Aug. 20. Volker told her that he was attempting to lift the hold on the aid by having the Ukrainians publicly launch investigations being sought by Trump. Trump, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1193896275093184512">meanwhile</a>, accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of doctoring the transcripts from closed-door depositions conducted by House investigators.

<p><strong>Mick Mulvaney asked to join a federal lawsuit over whether Congress can compel senior Trump advisers to testify as part of the House impeachment inquiry</strong>. One of Trump’s former top national security advisers, Charles Kupperman, filed the suit last month, saying that he faces conflicting orders from Congress and the White House regarding his obligation to participate in the inquiry. Mulvaney’s attorneys said the acting White House chief of staff faces the same dilemma, which is why he skipped his scheduled deposition last week and claimed that he was protected by “absolute immunity.” (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/09/mulvaney-asks-join-lawsuit-over-conflicting-demands-impeachment-testimony/">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/08/mulvaney-kupperman-suit-068305">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/09/us/politics/mulvaney-trump-impeachment-subpoenas.html">New York Times</a>)</p>

Mulvaney informed investigators “one minute” before his scheduled deposition that he would not appear, citing “absolute immunity.” During an Oct. 17 press conference, Mulvaney admitted that Trump froze military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to open a political investigation.

The whistleblower’s attorney, meanwhile, issued a cease and desist letter to the White House due to Trump’s “rhetoric and activity that places” the whistleblower “in physical danger.” Trump has repeatedly attacked the credibility of the whistleblower, demanded to “meet his accuser,” and called for the identity of the whistleblower to be revealed publicly.

Graham said he has “written the whole [impeachment] process off” as “a bunch of B.S.” Graham also downplayed Gordon Sondland’s revised testimony, during which Sondland acknowledged that he told a Ukrainian official that the release of U.S. military aid to Ukraine would “likely not occur” unless Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly announced an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Last month, however, Graham said, “If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.” Yesterday, Graham reiterated his blanket defense of Trump, adding: “I don’t think the president did anything wrong.” (<a href="https://www.axios.com/lindsey-graham-gordon-sondland-ukraine-transcript-427b75e1-af3e-47bd-8590-8fb320738f78.html">Axios</a> / <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-world/lindsey-graham-wont-read-impeachment-transcripts/507-5b8f1fe8-598f-480c-8190-e242f3b8cb25">WKYC</a>)</p>

<p><strong>A key witness in the impeachment inquiry acknowledged that there was a quid pro quo linking U.S. aid to Ukraine with an investigation into Trump’s political rival</strong>. In revised testimony, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said he told Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian national security adviser, that Ukraine “would likely not” receive military aid until it publicly committed to investigating the 2016 election and Joe Biden. Sondland told Congress that his memory was “refreshed” after reviewing the opening statements by Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former adviser to Trump on Russian and European affairs. Sondland’s addendum also recounted a Sept. 1 meeting in Warsaw where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised his concerns to Mike Pence about the suspension of military aid. Sondland said he believed that withholding the $391 million in security assistance was “ill-advised,” but claimed he didn’t know “when, why or by whom the aid was suspended.” The revelation comes after House committees leading the impeachment inquiry released transcripts of witness testimony by Sondland and Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine.

Deputy campaign manager Rick Gates told Robert Mueller’s office in an April 2018 interview that Manafort had shared his theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking the DNC with him and other campaign aides shortly after the stolen emails were published in June 2016. Gates said Manafort’s theory echoed one that had been pushed by Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian businessman that Mueller’s office said had ties to Russian intelligence. Three years later, Trump brought up the same conspiracy theory during his July 2019 call with the Ukrainian president when he asked for a “favor,” which is now at the heart of Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.

<p><strong>The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine told House impeachment investigators that she felt “threatened” by Trump</strong> and his suggestion to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the July 25 phone call that she would be “going to go through some things.” Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled by Trump in May, told investigators that Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were working with Rudy Giuliani to smear her and had orchestrated her removal as ambassador to Kiev. The revelation comes after House Democrats released the first two interview transcripts with Yovanovitch and Michael McKinley, a former senior State Department adviser. McKinley described to investigators how he pressed top State Department officials to publicly support Yovanovitch, but that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied the request because he did not want to “draw undue attention” to Yovanovitch.

<p><strong>Four White House officials scheduled to give depositions today as part of the House’s impeachment inquiry refused to show up and testify</strong>. National Security Council attorneys John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis, along with Robert Blair, assistant to the president, and Brian McCormick, an associate director at the Office of Management and Budget, did not comply with congressional subpoenas for their testimony. Eisenberg claimed executive privilege, while Blair, Ellis, and McCormick didn’t appear because they weren’t able to have a Trump administration attorney present. Two other officials from the OMB, Michael Duffey and Russell Vought, also plan to skip their depositions later this week. Energy Secretary Rick Perry is scheduled to appear for a closed-door deposition on Wednesday, but will not be participating either.

<p><strong>One of Mick Mulvaney’s top allies is attempting to rally other administration officials to collectively defy Congressional subpoenas</strong> from Democrats involved in the House impeachment inquiry. Russel Vought, who leads the Office of Management and Budget, and two of his subordinates are attempting to demonstrate their loyalty to Trump while also creating a firewall around Trump’s alleged use of foreign aid to obtain political favors from a U.S. ally. The OMB is at the center of the impeachment inquiry because Democrats want information about why the office effectively froze U.S. military aid to Ukraine even though Congress had already appropriated for that country.

<p><strong>Trump would not commit to keeping the federal government open past a November 21 funding deadline</strong>, raising the possibility of a government shutdown as House Democrats expand their impeachment inquiry. Congress passed a short-term spending bill in September and would need to pass 12 appropriations bills to keep all federal agencies funded.

<p><strong>Democratic leaders directing the impeachment investigation see the Trump administration’s stonewalling as obstruction of Congress</strong>. Trump and the administration have tried to stop subpoenaed witnesses from testifying, blocked the executive branch from turning over documents, attacked witnesses as “Never Trumpers,” badgered the anonymous whistleblower, and have tried to publicly discredit the investigation as a “scam” overseen by “a totally compromised kangaroo court.” Democrats argue that the efforts infringed on the separation of powers and undermines congressional oversight duties as laid out in the Constitution.

<p><strong>The House approved a resolution to formally authorize and set ground rules for its impeachment inquiry into Trump</strong>. The resolution passed 232-196 almost entirely along party lines and outlines how the House will make the investigation more public, authorizes the House Intelligence Committee to release transcripts from past interviews, and gives Republicans the right to call witnesses, though those requests are subject to approval by Democrats. Before the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said “Today, we are further down the path of our inquiry,” calling it a “sad day,” because “nobody comes to Congress to impeach a president.” Minutes after the vote, the White House press secretary denounced the resolution as “a sham impeachment” and “a blatantly partisan attempt to destroy the president.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/house-impeachment-vote.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-rules-governing-next-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/31/bc2f5e7a-fbcc-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-official-who-is-stepping-down-will-testify-in-impeachment-inquiry-11572514202">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-31/house-votes-to-open-public-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/31/house-takes-big-step-on-impeachment-with-vote-to-formalize-trump-probe-000311">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/politics/house-impeachment-inquiry-resolution-floor-vote/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sad-day-country-dem-house-debates-impeachment-resolution/story?id=66661743">ABC News</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump’s former top National Security Council advisor on Russia and Europe corroborated testimony by the acting ambassador to Ukraine that Trump tried to withhold military assistance until Ukraine committed to investigating Trump’s political rivals</strong>. Tim Morrison told impeachment investigators today that he spoke to Bill Taylor at least twice in early September. One call was about Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who told the Ukrainians that no U.S. aid would be released until they announced an investigation into Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that had hired Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Morrison also spoke with Taylor on Sept. 7 to share his “sinking feeling” about a conversation between Trump and Sondland, during which Trump demanded that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly announce investigations and a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. Morrison, however, told impeachment investigators he “was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed,” but he did see the episode as problematic for U.S. foreign policy. Morrison’s testimony comes a day after he announced his resignation.

<p><strong>The deputy White House counsel moved the transcript of Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky to the highly classified server after Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman raised concerns about Trump’s behavior</strong>. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, had listened in on the call when Trump asked Zelensky to “do us a favor” by pursuing an investigation into Biden and the debunked conspiracy theory that a Democratic National Committee server was transported to Ukraine after it was hacked in 2016. After the call was over, Vindman, an ethics attorney on the National Security Council, and a deputy legal adviser to the National Security Council met with John Eisenberg to raise concerns about the conversation. Eisenberg then ordered the transcript of the call moved to the NSC Intelligence Collaboration Environment, which is normally reserved for code-word-level ­intelligence programs, to ensure that people who were not assigned to handle Ukraine policy could not read the transcript. Vindman also told House impeachment investigators that the White House transcript of the July call omitted crucial words and phrases, including Trump’s assertion that there were recordings of Biden discussing Ukraine corruption and a mention by Zelensky about Burisma. Vindman was also given a hard copy of the rough transcript to make written edits, which he then gave to his boss, Tim Morrison.

<p><strong>Two separate federal judges in Washington will consider whether to force two witnesses close to Trump to testify in the House’s impeachment inquiry</strong>. The first hearing centers on former White House counsel Don McGahn’s refusal to testify this spring in the House Judiciary Committee’s criminal probe into whether Trump obstructed justice by attempting to impede the Russia investigation. The White House blocked McGahn’s testimony, claiming he was “absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony.” The second hearing involves former National Security official Charles Kupperman, who did not appear for his subpoenaed testimony on Monday. Last week, Charles Kupperman filed a lawsuit to resolve conflicting orders from Congress and the White House about his participation in the impeachment investigation.

<p><strong>House Democrats released their impeachment resolution</strong>, which outlines the next steps by the six committees that are pursuing investigations of the Trump administration. The resolution doesn’t limit the scope of their ongoing probes and does not set a timeline for potential articles of impeachment. Under the proposed rules, the House Intelligence Committee will take the lead on planning public hearings as the inquiry advances and establish rules for Republicans to hear testimony from certain witnesses, but that those requests will be declined or approved by Adam Schiff. The House plans to vote on the resolution Thursday.

<p><strong>The top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council registered objections on two separate occasions regarding Trump’s handling of Ukraine</strong>. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman told impeachment investigators during a closed-door deposition that he heard Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son as a “favor” after Zelensky brought up the defense cooperation between the U.S. and Ukraine. Vindman said he was so “concerned by the call” and that Trump’s request could be seen as “a partisan play” that could “undermine U.S. national security” that he reported it to the NSC’s lead counsel out of a “sense of duty.” Vindman is the first White House official to testify who listened in on the July 25th phone call between Trump and Zelensky, and reportedly told impeachment investigators that he took notes during the call and made recommendations to the White House to correct the memo summarizing the conversation.

<p><strong>Vindman’s sworn statement contradicted Gordon Sondland’s testimony</strong>, who told House investigators that no one had raised concerns about Trump’s actions. Vindman testified that he confronted Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, after Sondland, Kurt Volker, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and then-national security adviser John Bolton met with senior Ukrainian officials at the White House about “Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the president.” Vindman testified that he told Sondland “that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.” Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, accused Sondland of perjuring himself during his closed-door testimony to impeachment investigators earlier this month. Vindman’s testimony <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/29/nsc-official-testimony-ukraine-perry-061244">also appears</a> to contradict Perry’s denials that he ever heard the Bidens discussed in relation to U.S. requests that Ukraine investigate corruption.

<p><strong>A top aide to Rep.

Derek Harvey has provided notes to House Republicans identifying the whistleblower’s name ahead of the depositions of Trump appointees and administration employees in the impeachment inquiry. His goal is to get the name of the whistleblower into the records of the proceedings, which could then be made public. Harvey was also “passing notes [to GOP lawmakers] the entire time” during ex-NSC Russia staffer Fiona Hill’s testimony.

<p><strong>The House of Representatives will vote on the Trump impeachment inquiry</strong>. The resolution “affirms the ongoing, existing investigation,” “establishes the procedure for hearings,” and “ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. It will mark the first floor vote on impeachment since Democrats formally launched their inquiry. Representative Jim McGovern, chairman of the House Rules Committee, will introduce the resolution on Tuesday with a full House vote scheduled for Thursday. Pelosi added: “We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/us/politics/trump-impeachment-subpoena-house.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/house-to-vote-on-resolution-establishing-next-steps-in-impeachment-inquiry-000302">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/impeachment-witness-fails-to-appear-waits-for-court-ruling-11572280661">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/10/28/4d316e64-f96a-11e9-8190-6be4deb56e01_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/witness-will-defy-subpoena-until-court-rules-impeachment-update">Bloomberg</a>)</p>

<p><strong>A former deputy national security adviser and one of Trump’s “closest confidential” advisers defied a congressional subpoena and failed to appear for a scheduled closed-door deposition before House impeachment investigators</strong>. Charles Kupperman filed a lawsuit seeking guidance from a federal judge about whether he should listen to the executive branch, which has invoked “constitutional immunity,” or to Congress. “Given the issue of separation of powers in this matter, it would be reasonable and appropriate to expect that all parties would want judicial clarity,” Kupperman said. Since there has not yet been a ruling, Kupperman declined to appear. Leaders of three House committees said his lawsuit is “lacking in legal merit and apparently coordinated with the White House,” and failure to appear for his deposition “will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding.” Kupperman listened in to the July 25th call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

<p><strong>House impeachment investigators are scrutinizing a National Security Council aide suspected of operating a second Ukraine backchannel</strong>. Fiona Hill, the National Security Council’s former senior director for Eurasian and Russian affairs, testified last week that she believed Kashyap Patel was improperly getting involved in Ukraine policy by sending information about Ukraine to Trump that could warp American policy. Senior White House officials reportedly grew concerned when Patel became so involved in the issue that at one point Trump wanted to discuss the documents with him, referring to Patel as one of his top Ukraine policy specialists. Patel is assigned to work on counterterrorism issues, not Ukraine policy, and was part of the Republican effort to undermine the Russia investigation.

Taylor provided an “excruciatingly detailed” opening statement that described “how pervasive the [quid pro quo] efforts were” by Trump and his allies, which they have denied.

<p><strong>The White House is conducting its own investigation into why a rough transcript of Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Zelensky was placed into a secret server for secure storage</strong>. Trump’s advisers and White House lawyers began the fact-finding review to find out why deputy White House counsel, John Eisenberg, placed the rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Eisenberg has said he limited access to the transcript over concerns about leaks.

<p><strong>The White House’s former top Russia adviser told impeachment investigators that Rudy Giuliani ran a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that circumvented U.S. officials and career diplomats in order to personally benefit Trump</strong>. Fiona Hill, who served as the senior official for Russia and Europe on the National Security Council, testified for about nine hours before three House panels regarding a July 10th meeting she attended with senior Ukrainian officials, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, and other U.S. officials in which the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who was working with Giuliani, raised the issue to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats, Joe Biden, and his son. Hill said she confronted Sondland about Giuliani’s actions, which were not coordinated with officials responsible for U.S. foreign policy.

Yovanovitch said she’d done nothing to deserve her dismissal and that she was confused when Trump “chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,” referring to Giuliani and a group of former Ukrainian officials who saw her as a political and financial threat to their interests.

<p><strong>The White House announced it will not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry, calling it an illegitimate and partisan effort “to overturn the results of the 2016 election.”</strong> White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent an eight-page letter to House Democratic leaders, declaring the impeachment inquiry a violation of historical precedent. The letter says the inquiry represents such an egregious violation of Trump’s due process rights that neither Trump nor the executive branch will willingly participate by providing testimony or documents going forward. The letter was sent hours after the State Department blocked Gordon Sondland from appearing at a deposition in front of House Democrats, and it sets the stage for a constitutional crisis between the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government.

<p><strong>Trump urged China to investigate Joe Biden and his son despite already facing impeachment for using the office of the presidency to press Ukraine to investigate a political rival</strong>. Trump said he hadn’t directly asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate the Bidens, but it’s “certainly something we could start thinking about.” Trump, Pence, and Attorney General William Barr have now solicited help from Ukraine, Australia, Italy, Britain, and China for assistance in discrediting Trump’s political opponents. Trump also doubled down on pressuring the Ukrainian president, saying that “if it were me, I would recommend that [Ukraine] start an investigation into the Bidens.” Trump’s efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate Biden in a July phone call set off the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, who are looking at whether Trump abused the power of his office for political gain.

<p><strong>Trump complained that House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is “BULLSHIT” that’s “wasting everyone’s time.”</strong> Trump also called Adam Schiff a “low life,” and a “dishonest guy” who “couldn’t carry” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s “blank strap” – an apparent reference to a “jock strap.” Trump also blamed the impeachment inquiry for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-street-tumbles-as-trade-war-threatens-u-s-economy-idUSKBN1WH1A0">declines</a> in the stock market and suggested staffers were inappropriately listening in on his phone calls.

<p><strong>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump</strong>. Pelosi told House Democrats in a closed door meeting she will support a formal impeachment inquiry, believing that Trump pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son and his administration’s subsequent refusal to share the whistleblower report with Congress has left the House with no alternative but to move forward with an inquiry. “It would be my intention with the consent of this caucus … to proceed with an impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi said. “He is asking a foreign government to help him in his campaign, that is a betrayal of his oath of office.” As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 166 Democrats supported some type of impeachment action — more than two-thirds of the 235-member caucus. Pelosi and top Democrats have privately discussed the creation of a special select committee – similar the one created in 1973 to investigate the Watergate scandal – to conduct the impeachment inquiry, rather than leaving the task with the House Judiciary Committee. Democrats are also discussing a resolution condemning Trump’s interaction with his Ukrainian counterpart to put lawmakers on the record. Trump, meanwhile, called the allegations a “witch hunt” and said impeachment will be “a positive for me in the election.” (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-acknowledges-withholding-funds-ukraine-n1058126">NBC News</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/pelosi-top-democrats-privately-discuss-creation-of-select-committee-for-impeachment/2019/09/24/af6f735a-dedf-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-face-critical-day-on-pursuing-impeachment-11569336620">Wall Street Journal</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/24/politics/democrats-impeachment-strategy/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-24/pelosi-to-back-trump-impeachment-inquiry-washington-post-says">Bloomberg</a> / <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/24/donald-trump-impeachment-congress-1509360">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/impeachment-calls-grow-amid-revelation-trump-ordered-block-on-ukraine-aid">The Guardian</a> / <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/462855-trump-impeachment-will-be-a-positive-for-me-in-the-election">The Hill</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Trump admitted that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, but blamed it on the United Nations for not contributing more to the Eastern European nation</strong>, naming Germany and France among the countries that should “put up money.” Trump also suggested he did nothing wrong, because “As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid.” Trump told reporters that in addition to Mulvaney, he also told Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hold the funds to encourage other nations to pay, but claimed, “there was no quid pro quo. There was no pressure applied, nothing.” Trump added that despite trailing the leading Democratic candidates in most polls, “I’m leading in the polls and they have no idea how to stop me.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the House may have now have “crossed the Rubicon” when it comes to impeachment. Schiff added that “There is no privilege that covers corruption. No privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,” and that the “only remedy” to such behavior is impeachment.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee is negotiating to secure Jeff Sessions’ testimony as part of its impeachment investigation of Trump</strong>. Democrats on the committee hope Sessions’ appearance will help bolster the inquiry, especially since Sessions has had a turbulent relationship with Trump. An attorney for Sessions said the former attorney general will not agree to testify unless he is subpoenaed.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution defining the rules for its impeachment investigation into Trump</strong>. The measure also triggers a House rule that gives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler the ability to deem committee hearings as impeachment hearings, allowing staffers to question witnesses for an hour at the end of every hearing, gives Trump’s lawyers the ability to respond in writing to public testimony, and allows the committee to collect information in secret “executive sessions.” The Judiciary Committee believes it has identified five areas of potential obstruction in Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, in addition to the hush-money payments to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump, and allegations that Trump has used his public office to benefit his private business. The resolution passed along party lines, 24-17.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to investigate Trump’s alleged involvement in the 2016 hush-money payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels</strong>. The committee plans to hold hearings and call witnesses involved in the scheme as soon as October, but say there is already enough evidence to name Trump as a co-conspirator. Michael Cohen previously pleaded guilty to two campaign finance crimes related to the hush-money payments. The renewed inquiry will serve as another aspect of the House’s consideration of whether or not to draft articles of impeachment against Trump.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House staff secretary Rob Porter for public testimony</strong>. Porter was a key witness in Mueller’s investigation into possible obstruction of justice by Trump and will now testify publicly about Trump’s efforts to impede the Russia investigation. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to receive a subpoena in the last month. The committee is currently weighing whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump. Porter resigned last year amid allegations that he abused his ex-wives.

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to testify publicly about potential obstruction of justice by Trump</strong>. The committee also issued a subpoena to former White House deputy chief of staff for policy Rick Dearborn. House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler said the two former Trump aides will testify publicly on Sept. 17th and expects their testimony “will help the Committee determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the President or other Article 1 remedies.” The Mueller report said Trump asked Lewandowski to convince then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself from the investigation into Russian election interference, and publicly say Trump had not done anything wrong.

<p><strong>A federal judge rejected the House Judiciary Committee’s attempt to link Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence with compelling Don McGahn to testify</strong>. The committee contends that the two lawsuits will expedite its decision whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump. House General Counsel Douglas Letter argued that the two cases should be paired in front of the judge, because both seek evidence for a potential impeachment and are based on the same set of facts. D.C. federal District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell ruled that connections between the two suits are “too superficial.” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/14/judge-rejects-mcgahn-grand-jury-lawsuits-1462917">Politico</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The House Judiciary Committee said it would petition a federal judge to unseal Robert Mueller’s secret grand jury evidence</strong>. Chairman Jerry Nadler argued that it’s essential that Congress “have access to all the relevant facts” – including witness testimony – in order to fully investigate potential abuses of power by Trump and his inner circle before deciding whether to recommend articles of impeachment. The petition does not seek the public release of the grand jury evidence. The committee will also continue its investigation during the House’s six-week summer recess and is working to obtain testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. Nadler said he is going to court today and again next week to file a lawsuit to force McGahn to testify.

Trump had sued to quash the subpoena, arguing that Congress had no legitimate legislative reason to request the documents, but Judge Mehta said that they do. “It is simply not fathomable,” Mehta wrote, “that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct — past or present — even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.” Trump has vowed to appeal Mehta’s ruling.

<p><strong>Shortly after being sworn in, freshman Michigan Democratic Rep.

Trump responded to Tlaib’s call for impeachment, saying: “You can’t impeach somebody who’s doing a great job.” (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/dems-livid-tlaib-impeachment-comment-1081370">Politico</a> / <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/04/democrats-congress-trump-impeach-rashida-tlaib">The Guardian</a> / <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/04/politics/rashida-tlaib-trump-impeachment-comments/index.html">CNN</a> / <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/trump-rails-about-impeachment-talk-as-democrats-downplay-the-issue.html">CNBC</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-pushes-back-on-impeachment-talk-citing-his-popularity-among-republicans/2019/01/04/6b9555b8-1014-11e9-831f-3aa2c2be4cbd_story.html">Washington Post</a> / <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democratic-leaders-try-to-quell-fresh-talk-of-impeachment-push-11546624483">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>

<p><strong>White House counsel Don McGahn will step down after the midterms or after Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court.</strong> McGahn was the top lawyer for the Trump campaign and has repeatedly considered resigning as White House counsel. He’s played the role of peacemaker between the White House and Robert Mueller’s team, as well as acting as Trump’s liaison to the Justice Department and Congress. Trump surprised McGahn with his Twitter announcement, since McGahn had not discussed his plans directly with Trump. McGahn’s successor will likely be Emmet Flood, an attorney who advised the Clinton administration during his impeachment hearings and served as White House counsel under George W. Bush. McGahn has said privately that after he steps down he plans to continue assisting Trump throughout his reelection campaign. Trump asked former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter “several times” last year if he would take McGahn’s position. Porter reportedly told him that he didn’t feel “he was qualified for the role.” Republicans see McGahn as a stable force and accessible official, and were dismayed by Trump’s announcement. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he hopes “it’s not true” that McGahn is leaving and urged Trump to not “let that happen.” (<a href="https://www.axios.com/don-mcgahn-white-house-counsel-departure-emmet-flood-b4aeedcd-ac15-4502-995a-1e972ffa530e.html">Axios</a> / <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/us/politics/don-mcgahn-white-house-counsel-trump.html">New York Times</a> / <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-white-house-counsel-donald-mcgahn-will-leave-his-job-in-the-fall/2018/08/29/f56828be-ab98-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>

And then take the risk of not getting Kavanaugh confirmed.” Nunes reiterated his belief that Rosenstein should be impeached, but said that “the question is the timing of it right before the election.” He also warned that “if Sessions won’t unrecuse and Mueller won’t clear the president, we’re the only ones” protecting Trump from the Mueller investigation.

<p><strong>Democratic congressman Al Green called for “the impeachment of the President of the United States of America for obstruction of justice.”</strong> Green said it was the House of Representative’s “duty” to take up impeachment. More Republicans and Democrats are starting to talk of the possibility that Trump could face impeachment after reports that he pressed James Comey to end an investigation of Michael Flynn. Representative Justin Amash said if the reports about Trump’s pressure on Comey are true, it would merit impeachment. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both raised concerns about Trump’s action, but avoided the topic of impeachment in their statements responding to the news of Comey’s memo. “At best, President Trump has committed a grave abuse of executive power,” Pelosi said. “At worst, he has obstructed justice.” Democrats can’t impeach Trump without significant Republican support.
